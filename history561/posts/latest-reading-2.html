<p><em>The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico</em>, by Bernal Diaz Del Castillo, is a firsthand account of the Spanish incursion into Mexico, from the earliest explorations to the fall of the Mexican Empire. The author participated in two excursions prior to that of Cortes. That they were not successful, and the difficulty of subduing Mexico, disputes the myth of Spanish superiority.<br /><br />The bulk of the text is devoted to Cortes&#8217; conquest of Mexico, accomplished more by securing allies than superior warfare. Indeed, Cortes seems more of a manipulator than a warrior. Cortes sneaked his way into heading the expedition. After scuttling the boats in which the party arrived, Cortes marched to Mexico, a city whose development amazed the Spanish. After kidnapping Montezuma and placing him under house arrest, the plan fell apart and Cortes and his party fled. After fending off a rival, he realigns himself with Native American allies and lays siege to Mexico. Though the Spanish lose many battles, they eventually outlast their foes and take the city. <br /><br />The work, as gripping as a centuries&#8217; old primary document can be, is obviously hyperbolic. The Spanish come across as brave warriors who double as missionaries, fighting dogs with no honor or scruples. The mission is obviously blessed by God, who gets the credit for every victory. Throughout the work, the author claims that the Native Americans believed the Spanish to be the men from across the sea that were destined to rule. <br /><br />Besides the obvious problems of firsthand accounts, chiefly motivation and possible lapse of memory, the work is also a translation, which adds another layer to the questions of bias and motivations for telling the narrative. Does <span class="caps">AP</span> Maudslay, the translator, buy into the story or is he an impartial observer? For example, he states in his commentary that the fate of the Spanish might have been much worse than that of the Native Americans had they lost. What is missing is the fact that the Spanish were invaders trying to disrupt a way of life. Still, <em>The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico </em>is a fascinating document when considered with its limitations, and an adventure story well worth reading regardless of its weaknesses.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-7704454804586417253?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article></article>
