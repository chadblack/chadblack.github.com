            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;We end the course, and this blog concludes, with an examination of one location of struggle over the interpretation and continued meanings of the Spanish conquest, in this case the conquest and settlement of New Mexico. Acting as a microcosm of sorts, the modern dispute over how to remember/memorialize/monumentalize the Conquest is emblematic of disputes over history not just in the Americas but throughout the modern world. Invariably comparisons to Hitler appear, as do allegations of genocide, racism, political correctness, and a host of others, often deployed by all sides involved. As several of the articles this week noted, the violence of the past is re-projected, &amp;#8216;ligamentally,&amp;#8217; into the present, as different groups and individuals within those groups align themselves with a real or perceived identity- both genealogical and presently emotional- between themselves and the actors in the&amp;nbsp;past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, of course, addressed somewhat across these articles, is that the past- and the present- is terribly messy. There are not, in the end, the sorts of clear good guys and bad guys we would like to uncover and deploy. Nor does the past fit neatly into our present day conceptions; only through a conscious or unconscious process of effacement and selective addition can any side in a given conflict or construction of memory arrive at the desired ends. Some things must be forgotten; some things must be deliberately remembered in order to arrive at forgetting. Even more problematically, few struggles over memory exist in a strict binary which could lend itself to clear good guys and bad guys across time. In the case of New Mexico, Hispanics can lay claim to their own narrative of oppression and violence directed against them, whether via stories of the massacres of Po&amp;#8217;pay&amp;#8217;s revolt, or of later Anglo-American conquest and domination. They can simultaneously employ narratives of victory and of subjugation, while also being subjected to the charge of being oppressive and racist&amp;nbsp;themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am reminded in all of this of my own conflicted experience and identity as a white Southern American (with indigenous ancestry as well, though its history of deployment in my own family and across the South is ambiguous and conflicted): articulations of Southern identity and memory seem to largely oscillate between being the &amp;#8216;bad Americans&amp;#8217; whose past (and present) is a fitting target for opprobrium and disgust by non-Southerners. As white yet highly rural and still heavily religious the white South provides, and has long provided, a convenient location to express emotions and sentiments that would be dangerous to deploy against non-white minorities. Yet the all too typical white Southerner&amp;#8217;s reaction to this effective demonization and marginalization is to go in the opposite direction, and to seek to efface and forget the very real &amp;#8216;sins of our fathers&amp;#8217;; the present our past as only one of heroics and proudly produced and defended traditional culture, without allowing for any of the messiness and moral ambiguity and outright abuses and evils that also make up our past (and the past of everyone else on the planet). Navigating between these two extremes is not restricted to us, or to the heirs of the Spanish conquest. It is- if I may indulge in a universal statement- an experience that spans the globe, even if it is not always felt with the same acuteness. Finding ways of remembering and even constructing the past- our pasts, real and imagined- has long been a human endeavor, and we still have a great ways to go before we come to any sort of truly constructive and humane&amp;nbsp;conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt; This week, we read six articles.&lt;br /&gt;
•    Elizabeth Archuleta, “Memorializing Po’Pay and Oñate, or Recasting Racialized Regimes of Representation,” New Mexico Historical Review (Summer 2007):317-337.&lt;br /&gt;
•   Kathy Freise, “Contesting Oñate: Sculpting the Shape of Memory,” in Expressing New Mexico: Nuevomexicano Creativity, Ritual, and Memory (233-252).&lt;br /&gt;
•   Phillip Gonzales, “History Hits the Heart”: Albuquerque’s Great Cuartocentenario Controversy, 1997-2005,” in Expressing New Mexico: Nuevomexicano Creativity, Ritual, and Memory (207-232).&lt;br /&gt;
•   Alfredo Jiménez, “Don Juan de Oñate and the Founding of New Mexico: Possible Gains and Losses from Centennial Celebrations,” Colonial Latin American Historical Review 7.2 (Spring 1998): 109-128.&lt;br /&gt;
•   Menchú, Rigoberta. “The Quincentenary, a Question of Class, Not Race: An Interview with Rigoberta Menchú, Latin American Perspectives, 1992.&lt;br /&gt;
•   Stern, Steve. “Paradigms of Conquest: History, Historiography, and Politics. Journal of Latin American Studies, Vol. 24 (1992), 1-34.&lt;br /&gt;
•   Vargas Llosa, Mario. “Questions of Conquest: What Columbus Wrought, and What He Did Not,” Harpers Magazine, December&amp;nbsp;1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Elizabeth Archuleta covered the conflicts over statues of Juan de Onate and Po-Pay.  Archuleta reminds us, “Cultural production is never power-neutral” (321).  The rhetoric of the polarized sides of the conflict reflect aspects of contemporary racialization and its links with the&amp;nbsp;past.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gonzales article discssed the quadricentennial of the conquest of New Mexico.  Conflicts over a proposed scultpture of Juan de Oñate ignited a political battle; the author says that the symbolic violence of conflict over Oñate reflects the actual violence of the past (219).  Pueblos opposed memorializing the violent conquistador Oñate (who cut off the feet of Indians who resisted him—an action for which the Spanish colonial government in Mexico hauled Oñate into court and convicted him). Hispanics saw him as a heroic figure, bringing civilization to the continent.  Both sides were arguing for their version of a collective identity that was really just identity&amp;nbsp;politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frieze discusses the actual sculpture that was created after the political battle Gonzales describes.  It was a divided memorial.  One part, “La Jornada,” was full of figural sculptures, represented Oñate and the settlers—the Spanish side of the conquest.  The other part of the memorial is dubbed “The Environment,” and is a spiral path that visitors actually walk through, leading to a spring, or representation of the womb of the earth, at the center.  Frieze points out that these two monuments are physically separated—connected only by a plaque that many visitors may not even actually read—much like the collective memory of the events. She says that monuments like these give shape to the past in the way that they portray&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiminez joins the debate about remembering the violence of the conquest, making the point that historians’ role is to embed the violent events of conquest—whether Oñate’s deviant acts of violence or Popé’s uprising—in their own cultural and historical contexts. Jiminez calls for resisting the “good guy” and “bad guy” stereotypes from Western movies, and trying to achieve historical&amp;nbsp;objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rigoberta Menchú, indigenous activist and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, adds another voice to the conversation.  Menchú calls for ending the oppression of indigenous Americans, including the undervaluing of their precolumbian history and the celebration of the “discovery” of the Americas.  She emphasizes that the issue is a class struggle more than a racial&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historian of world history Steve J. Stern analyzes 1492 as a loaded symbol and deals with the intersection of history, historiography, and politics academically.  Stern says of the commemoration of 1492, “For indigenous Americans, and many Latin Americans and indigenous sympathizers, the event invites a denunciation of five centuries of exploitation and ethnocide, a commemoration of five centuries of resistance and survival against formidable odds. But ethnic critique can cut in several directions at once.” Stern points out that the Black Legend and stereotypes of the Spanish abound.  Stern notes that remembering 1492 can take the form of progressive multiculturalism or conservative backlash (e.g. the Hispanophilia that Archuleta and Gonzalez were discussing).  Stern does not think that we can achieve a nonpolitical reading of 1492, and of Conquest.  Rather, he argues that it should be understood according to its own times.  There was no single meaning of conquest even as it was enacted—even among the conquerors, who were divided by internal hierarchies, factions, and power struggles.  An example of this would be the Dominican Bartolomé de Las Casas’ critique of the empire—which was motivated by political struggles within the Catholic&amp;nbsp;church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stern also points out that the Black Legend of Spanish avarice and cruelty do a disservice to the complicated nature of the Spanish Conquest and the indigenous response to it.  Stern writes, “Amerindian peoples simply refused to concede a Spanish monopoly on access to high authority, social reward, and policy debate” (18).  They reinvented Spanish cultural and political forms, interpreted the conquest on their own terms, and competed with the Spanish economically—and in every other way.  When we remember the conquest today, Stern argues we must remember that there was no clear meaning of conquest as it happened.  Rather, it meant different things to different players—conquistadors, settlers, indigenous entrepreneurs, and&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mario Vargas Llosa’s article thoroughly reproduces the Black Legend—and unwittingly demonstrates all that is wrong with it.  Oh, where to begin!  His claim that the Inca were conquered by 180 Spaniards because they were poor decision makers is patently absurd.  Vargas Llosa reproduces the myth of native desolation, and the myth that a few “Great” Spaniards defeating indigenous hordes.  This is a cautionary tale about history as myth, and what happens when memory is reduced to a stereotype and a tragic literary&amp;nbsp;narrative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject of the Spanish conquest—especially how we deal with remembering and teaching and thinking about the violent aspects of it—is complicated.  Yes, there were certainly acts of violence.  But the Black Legend reduces a very complicated, negotiated reality into a caricature that does great violence to historical truth.  Issues of collective memory, and memorializing history, often depend on modern notions of&amp;nbsp;identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the New Mexicans fighting over statues of Oñate and Popé.  Imagined histories of valorous conquest in the name of civilization, or of the wholesale destruction of a helpless native world, can take over.  The collective memory of medieval violence acted against one group or the other can rise up to epic proportions in our own&amp;nbsp;time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Black Legend was not the reality of the Spanish conquest.  The sixteenth century was a complicated world, where there was violence on both sides.  Indigenous allies of the Spanish played a huge role in that violence.  People on both sides made pragmatic choices in the face of great change.  There was a great deal of cultural convergence that shaped the conquest, and led to communication and miscommunication and “double mistaken identity” (where each side assumes a given event is functioning according to its own cultural&amp;nbsp;interpretation).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, this course has taught me a great deal about both the Spanish conquest and the practice of history.  The Black Legend is out.  Complicated, messy, historical reality is in—and it’s infinitely more&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;In summing up our discussion of the conquest in this class it seems fitting that we ended on the articles for this week.  The main theme of the articles is how the conquest is being dealt with today.  While it has been over 500 years since Columbus accidentally found his way to the Caribbean tempers do still run high.  So the question is how do we deal with this?  As we saw with the founder’s statue in New Mexico coming to an agreement that culturally respects all parties is an unending battle.  I run into this problem a lot is archaeology, where do you draw the line between studying and representing the past while still being culturally sensitive?  At least in the situation of the statues in New Mexico an agreement that dealt with most of the issues was achieved but that is not always the case.  In some cases groups would prefer to completely strip moments from the past and take them out of our history.  Victim identity has become such a powerful component in Native American culture that it can be frustrating at times.  Take for instance a run of the mill book store.  Since I study Native American Archaeology I always run through the Native American Anthropology section and the shelves are filled with books that concern the conquest and the aftermath.  Rarely is there a single book about the 20,000 plus years Native American groups thrived on two continents developing complex cultures and erecting beautiful monuments.  So even when we focus on the Native American perspective it is still restricted to a very brief subject.  I would like to see our culture empress our whole history, some things may be painful be we should by no means forget them.  So in ending this blog for this course I would like to say that I have enjoyed learning more about the conquest, however, I am not sure where we should go from here.  Tempers are still raging for some while others are finding ways to work together on both sides.  Finding a solution is still far off but at least we are discussing the problems we will all be facing more openly and hopefully that will lead so some form of common&amp;nbsp;ground…………&lt;/p&gt;

            <title type="html">Some Final Thoughts</title>
            <author><name>Chad Black</name></author>
            <link href="/history561/posts/some-final-thoughts.html"/>
            <updated>2010-04-26T19:11:06Z</updated>
            <published>2010-04-26T19:11:06Z</published>
            <id>/history561/posts/some-final-thoughts.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I enrolled in this class for three reasons:  1) I have long been fascinated with the Reconquista, which has led to an interest in the early modern Spanish Empire; 2) I am principally interested in studying the social and cultural history of government during a period of conquest, and so studying this Conquest seemed like a good place to do some comparative history; 3) I didn&amp;#8217;t know anything about Latin America (even though I&amp;#8217;ve been there) and thought that should&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this semester, I have satisfied these reasons.  Reading Bernal Diaz and the Cortes letters certainly presented the Conquest as the capstone event of the Reconquista, and these texts were fascinating in their own right.  It is fair to say that I now know significantly more about Latin America than I did in December, though I also recognize that the significant nineteenth century is still murky for me.  As for comparing the Conquest and the establishment of Spanish authority in the New World to the creation of the barbarian kingdoms in fifth-century Europe, I gained much from this course.  The two phenomena are only marginally similar, but it struck me that the manner in which Cortes treated Charles V may be very similar to the manner in which barbarian kings regarded the Roman Empire.  In particular, the letters of Cortes seem to be a prime example of how one could operate in the grey areas of pre-modern political authority and legitimacy.  Cortes&amp;#8217;s efforts toward securing an office from Charles V seem to mirror exactly the efforts of barbarian kings toward securing official Roman administrative positions after they had already taken de facto control of parts of the&amp;nbsp;empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this course had me reevaluate my conception of the undergraduate (and high school) Western History class.  I had always thought of the Conquest and the Spanish experience in the New World as a matter for World or American History classes.  That now seems silly to me.  For one thing, the transmission of Western civilization to the New World is significant and requires emphasis in a broader context.   At the same time, the encounter that created the early modern Atlantic Civilization wrought important changes in Europe that simply cannot make sense outside of such a context.  Too, I&amp;#8217;ve rethought the colonial experience in the Americas.  I have never appreciated the extent or duration of Spanish control in the present-day United States.  It now seems to me that there would be much value in beginning American History courses with the Spanish experience in Florida and New Mexico rather than the British experience in Massachusetts and Virginia.  Indeed, if I ever again find myself teaching an American History course in a high school, I may try to teach the class entirely from the Spanish perspective, only turning to the perspective from the United States after the Mexican-American&amp;nbsp;War.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;And now every April I sit on my porch&lt;br /&gt;
And I watch the parade pass before me&lt;br /&gt;
And I watch my old comrades, how proudly they march&lt;br /&gt;
Reliving old dreams of past glory&lt;br /&gt;
And the old men march slowly, all bent, stiff and sore&lt;br /&gt;
The forgotten heroes from a forgotten war&lt;br /&gt;
And the young people ask, &amp;#8220;What are they marching for?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
And I ask myself the same question&lt;br /&gt;
And the band plays Waltzing Matilda&lt;br /&gt;
And the old men answer to the call&lt;br /&gt;
But year after year their numbers get fewer&lt;br /&gt;
Some day no one will march there at all&lt;br /&gt;
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda&lt;br /&gt;
Who&amp;#8217;ll come a waltzing Matilda with me&lt;br /&gt;
And their ghosts may be heard as you pass the Billabong&lt;br /&gt;
Who&amp;#8217;ll come-a-waltzing Matilda with&amp;nbsp;me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function of memory on historical narrative is something that is near and dear to my heart.  On a more general level I am also interested in the ways that historians, with their educator hat on, interact with the general public.   Basically, I’m a “public history buff,” so this week’s readings were right up my alley. (Despite my disdain for the word “buff”). I especially liked anything and everything having to do with the controversy over Onate’s statue.&lt;br /&gt;
Both the “civic warlords and the foot soldiers of the present” (From “History Hits the Heart (232)) do make a habit of collectively dredging the rivers of time looking for the fragile vestiges of their identities. (That’s my well-written sentence for the day).  This is a common enterprise and one that fascinates me, tea-baggers, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;DAR&lt;/span&gt;, and founding fathers included.   Both sides seem to cast their “ancestors” In a mold of suppliers of progressive technologies which made New Mexico what it is today.  Another fact that I find fascinating is the ways that these smaller pools of collective memory are piped into larger circuits of national identity—here I am specifically thinking of the references to George Washington and Adolf Hitler.&lt;br /&gt;
Violence also seems to be a cool talking point for people involved in these debates. On the surface it would seem to connect modern activists and the people whom they claim to speak for.  We can fight just as well as you can, or so they seem to think.  But the past is a different world, as we seem to come back to.  The things that are meaningful in the here and now are not always the same, despite a similar veneer, as things with the exact same name.  I think few, though some, of the people who vehemently argued for or against the Onate statue, would publically maintain such polemical positions in the face of the events they’re arguing over.&lt;br /&gt;
So I guess this is a nice place for my own reflection on the Conquest and this class. What does the Conquest mean to me?  It is certainly an exceptional event, but by the same logic that makes it exceptional, I think that any number of other events, in and of themselves, might also be exceptional.  In a broader context, both spatially and temporally, it takes on a greater significance.  The meeting of the two worlds seems important to me at for at least what we can learn from it.  Perhaps there are some lessons here if we ever do meet extra-terrestrials, but my instinct is that if we ever do, it will either play out in a completely different way or one that is strikingly similar.  (Writing this does make me wonder the literary influence of the Conquest on the genre of sci-fi.)  There also are some lessons about history in general.  Things can seem the same and be strikingly different.  The past is a valuable tool for the present.  I’m running out of steam at this point, probably because of my current fixation on “a-papering” but am glad that I got to take course on such an important time period. Important precisely because of the controversies brought out by this week’s readings.  I wish I had nothing else to do for a few weeks but think about the Conquest.  Perhaps I might come up with a better blog&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Sorry for the lack of enthusiasm….but I’m just not feeling it&amp;nbsp;today. &lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The first three essays discussed here, by Elizabeth Archuleta, Kathy Freise, and Phillip B. Gonzales, all deal with the subjectivity of memory and, by extrapolation, history. Archuleta’s “History Carved in Stone” discusses and analyzes national (nationalistic?) monuments and their significance and often enduring contradictions. Mount  Rushmore, with its quasi-likenesses of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt, symbolizes “independence, the nation’s birth, territorial expansion, national unity, and the ‘equality’ for all citizens” (317-8). Yet she is quite right to point out that Mount  Rushmore is not far from the site of the Wounded Knee Massacre—something &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; History scholars should be more attuned to. The crux of her argument entails discussion of the ways in which Don Juan de Onate and Po’Pay, the conqueror of New Mexico and leader of the Pueblo revolt, respectively, have been remembered and continue to be memorialized. As she claims, traditional historical narratives “ask us to forget past violence, but American Indians cannot overlook the historical events that forever transformed their lives” (325). How, then, to understand a history forged from a non-consensual encounter (if you’ll forgive the clinical&amp;nbsp;phrasing)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar problem runs through the articles by Freise and Gonzales, who both discuss New Mexico’s “Cuartocentenario Controversy.” How to memorialize Onate and the Indians he brutalized? Was such an approach feasible or possible? As Freise phrases it, “Can the story that those who shaped the memorial were asked to tell…be told without the lead character, whether hero or villain?” Her question is prescient, and probably unanswerable, since even if the main character is deleted form the scene, a generic “Spaniard” or “Spaniards” will remain, and remain controversial. Of particular worth in her article, moreover, is her analysis of the distinction between  memorial and a monument. She memorably terms this “codes of remembrance” (243). Monuments, so she argues (and I agree) mark victories; memorials are more elegiac, and perhaps more subjective in their effect. Memorials, ideally, “point to the tension of the past that seeps into the present and taps into the instability of memory itself” (246). Gonzales’ essay articulates the inherent tension in the Cuartocentenario situation more forcefully. “For centuries,” he writes, “American Indians suffered both hostility in being considered vestiges of the uncivilized ‘savage’ and condescension in being connected to the quaintly primitive” (211). Given this traditional hostility, how does one explain ethnic and cultural diversity? On the one hand, diversity is, publicly at least, one of the most celebrated attributes—nothing is more politically correct right now than diversity. And yet, that diversity came about through violence and rape both literal and figurative. “To glorify Onate,” he writes, “it was necessary to leave major episodes of his story aside” (214). The message is clear: history with purposeful omissions cannot be true history. Pro-Onate advocates speak of the benefits brought by the Spanish to the region. The same, of course, has been said about the positive attributes of the European colonization of&amp;nbsp;Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfredo Jimenez’s article about the same celebrations perhaps best expresses the difficulty of approaching a topic (or milestone) from sharply contrasting worldviews. As Jimenez claims, the rise of the Spanish American empire was a tremendous thing, and Onate was undeniably in a world of rapid transformation—a situation he was able to manipulate for his own personal goals and gain. At the same time, however, the Native Americans in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres were not biding their time in an idyllic paradise. “[W]arfare, conquest, and subjugation were the rule throughout the western hemisphere…” (111). Yet he is not, as I se it, an apologist. “History and centennials,” he writes, “do not have to wait until the present for the trial of Don Juan de Onate” (121). The so-called “last conquistador” was himself tried in Mexico City and obliged for forfeit his titles and a substantial part of his&amp;nbsp;riches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the indigenous peoples, the sixteenth (and seventeenth, and eighteenth) centuries were marked by fear and uncertainty. For the Europeans, those years represented the pinnacle of progress. Perhaps the best way to examine the tumultuous time is to recognize that all historical actors are products of their environment. Furthermore, it is not the historian’s job to condemn (or condone) the actions of people in the past, but to explain them on their own terms (without excusing their often heinous actions). Is it possible to remember without potentially controversial memorials? Probably not, but centennial celebrations do seem to cause more anxiety than understanding, and more agitation than&amp;nbsp;education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rigoberta Menchu certainly seems to think so. Regarding the 1992 Quincentenary, for example, she claims, convincingly, that &amp;#8220;A just evaluation of history seems to have been set aside.&amp;#8221; Persuasively, she argues that milestones such as these need not be automatic celebrations, but rather evaluations of historical events. Of course, whether one can summon up the energy to do so without a hero is another question. Novelist Maria Vagas Llosa expounds upon this educational, rather than celebratory, approach. (I think she uses her history professor, Raul Porras Barrenechea, to good effect here.) How to understand the fall of the Inca, one of the few civilizations in world history to eliminate hunger from its population? Llosa argues that it cannot be done without a comprehensive understanding of who the Tawantinsuyu were and what comprised their worldviews. When the Inca himself was killed, given the &amp;#8220;vertical and totalitarian structure&amp;#8221; of their society, the Tawantinsuyu believed they had no choice but to die (albeit heroically, as Llosa notes). Despite their genius at organization, she claims, the stregth of the society was misleading. They were not capable of &amp;#8220;facing the unexpected.&amp;#8221; But, again, how should historians judge the fall of the indienous Peruvian empire, given that it was a totalitarian state, and its fall opened the way for the individual? Given the enduring poverty and hunger in modern-day Peru, Llosa leaves little question as to where she stands on the&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Thought One &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week’s readings shed light on the continuing fight for the past. What gets commemorated and what gets ignored? When historical events or figures are placed in either category, it says as much about the people doing the categorizing as it does the importance of the subject under consideration. The same can be said of those who write more formal history, intended or not. It’s easy to see this phenomenon in writers such as Hernan Cortes or William Prescott. We have the advantage of temporal distance. We have the advantage of knowing the larger context in which they wrote. But what are the contexts in which we are writing? Alfredo Jimenez stated, “Although complete objectivity can never be achieved, a permanent search for truth is an aspiration that guides historians in their work. Absolute truths do not exist in human affairs; at best there are many truths to be compared and shared.” As much as we would like to see our carefully crafted views of the past as absolute truth, what intellectual baggage are we carrying? Perhaps one day in the decades or centuries to come, if we’re lucky enough to write something considered worthy of commemoration, critics will say it says as much about the early twenty-first century as it does the subject at hand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought Two&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How important are historians to the shaping of the past? In the fight for the past, are historians the generals? Or even lieutenants? On one hand, everyone who attended school has presumably digested a history textbook to some degree. And everyone who has attended school has heard a history teacher express his or her opinions on the past. And when a non-historian wants to understand a segment of history, they will most likely turn to a book written by a historian. (Or turn to Wikipedia, which throws a wedge into the argument.) This would suggest that historians play an important role in shaping the past. But what about collective memory? Phillip Gonzales calls collective memory “selective remembrance shaped preeminently by group loyalty.” Do group dynamics determine what is remembered and what is not, regardless of the importance placed on the historical figure or event by historians? Are historians trees falling in the forest? Do we only make a sound if someone is around to hear it? Do we only shape collective memory if the public wants to hear our voices? In the continuing fight for the past, perhaps we are the advisers to the generals. But some generals never heed even the best advice.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-7054581785169436991?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=btoU7yvmVzUC&amp;amp;dq=Puritan+Conquistadors&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=bn&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=_grNS4WjGIbY8AT-9sXBDw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=4&amp;amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;Puritan Conquistadors: Iberianizing the Atlantic, 1550-1700&lt;/a&gt;, while not without its problems, is a fascinating and enjoyable study of the points of convergence between Catholic Iberians in Central and South America, and Puritan English in New England in North America. Despite the evident, and usually highlighted, differences between the two, Esguerra argues for numerous similarities and common trends in the ways that both societies understood and depicted their colonizing efforts in the Americas. Paramount, Eguerra argues, was the employment of demonological tropes in constructing both the indigenous peoples and the New World, and the opposing sides in the attempt to control the new lands on the west side of the&amp;nbsp;Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This common approach stems from a shared Western Christian intellectual culture and common discourse, built in great part through the reading, exegesis, and localized employment of the Bible. Esguerra brings up numerous examples of direct exegesis of the Bible in behalf of colonizing endeavors; even more frequent are more subtle background traces of a shared Christian discourse established through centuries of Western European contact and engagement with Christianity and especially Christianity&amp;#8217;s sacred text. Whether through the lens of crusading or further refracted through such values as chivalry, certain ideas about and ways of seeing the world came to be established, in both Iberia and England, through a long history of this engagement with Christianity and the Bible. As a result, both societies employed their common heritage, reflected through their particular post-Reformation trajectories, in justifying and speaking about and understanding their conquest and control of the&amp;nbsp;Americas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In establishing all of this Esguerra is quite convincing. It goes a long ways towards supporting his contention in the final chapter that the Americas should be viewed as a whole- he implies as uniformly Western, not as a dichotomy of West versus the Rest, with the Rest including Latin America (how a region with that most Western of appellatives, Latin, could be other than Western, I have never understood&amp;#8230;). Some of his attempts to point out parallels in discourses fall a little flat, usually because of the superabundance of convincing evidence on one side alongside a marked lack on the other. Sometimes I suspect that what he implies to be influence is better interpreted as a working out of similar deposits, a common trajectory, without a great deal of later interpenetration. Sacred texts in particular have a great deal of textual power; there are exegetical moves and interpretations that are common, more or less, in medieval Christian communities from Central Asia to the western coast of Ireland, with no actual influence between them, just a shared sacred text and some shared methods of&amp;nbsp;interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related note, sometimes the focus on the demonic felt a little forced, conditioning the material- perhaps a broader focus would have been helpful. Certainly the material covered is broad: from depictions of the New World as a demonically diseased garden in need of weeding and renewal, to the existence of signs of God in the very vegetation of the Americas: the range of discourses Esguerra covers is truly broad, which, if nothing else, keeps this book continually interesting. And Esguerra is generous with illustrations, but not simply as breaks in the text- he actually does a good job integrating them into the argument of the text, reminding us of the visceral quality of even highly intellectual arguments, as the intellectual discourses met and materialized in the Americas, whether under Iberian or Puritan&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Allergic reaction to a food you ate?  Must be Satan.  Storm? Shipwreck?  Must be Satan.  Indian uprising? Again, Satan. Opossum sighting?  Don’t be fooled&amp;#8211;clearly, it’s only Satan in disguise.  As I read Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra’s book, Puritan Conquistadors, I kept hearing Dana Carvey’s “Church Lady” from Saturday Night Live in the nineties, in my head, giggling, “Must be&amp;nbsp;Satan!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry; I just couldn’t help myself. But now that that’s out of my system, let’s get&amp;nbsp;serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cañizares-Esguerra writes, “British Protestants and Spanish Catholics deployed similar religious discourses to explain and justify conquest and colonization: a Biblically sanctioned interpretation of expansion, part of a long-standing Christian tradition of holy violence aimed at demonic enemies” (p. 9). The Spanish and the British, it seems, were not so different as much of colonial American historiography would have us believe.  Both groups understood colonization as an epic struggle against the power of Satan, who, they believed, had enjoyed millennia of unchallenged tyrannical dominion over the weak, effeminate Indians of the Americas.  A demonological discourse structured the way both Iberian Catholics and English Puritans thought about colonization and the New World.  In fact, they saw colonization itself as a kind of exorcism.  Even nature, in this worldview, was manipulated by devils. Storms, poisonous plants, even the poor opossum—all were indications of the evil one’s work in the New&amp;nbsp;World.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, “The devil operated in the New World by eroding the racial and social hierarchies of the well-ordered polity” (26-7), so satanic agency could be transferred to anyone’s enemy.  Satan could work through the Spanish, the Indians, and even&amp;nbsp;storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is so stunning about Cañizares-Esguerra’s accomplishment is the way he seamlessly weaves together the mental worlds of Iberian Catholics and Protestant Puritans.  The author drives a big nail into the coffin of American exceptionalism, and his point is well taken, if, perhaps, a wee bit over-the-top at&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapters 1-5 are lucidly organized, cleverly analyzed, and convincingly argued.  But as to the historiographically-oriented Chapter 6, which asks why historians have missed the similarity between Iberian and Puritan discourses of demonology, I offer another explanation: It must be&amp;nbsp;Satan.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I congratulate Canizares-Esguerra for succeeding in his goal of writing a book that doesn’t fit neatly into any genre.  I’m a fanboy of the Atlantic World so approached his book with all the auspices in line.   Puritan Conquistadors: Iberianizing the Atlantic is a confusing title.  I certainly understand his point that the literary traditions of both England and Spain (for this is what is meant by Iberia) were part of larger “Purifying” discourse, but the title seems to indicate that there is a more direct process occurring. His conclusion also led me to believe that the title is indicative of a conscious effort to upset the more northerly orientation of Atlantic World historiography.&lt;br /&gt;
    Canizares-Esguerra’s claims that he will write with a brash style that “seek[s] to reconstruct a worldview that is equally violent, alien, and offensive to our modern sense of what is physically possible” (17). Of course this begs the question: whose world-view.  And what is physically possible?  Though I don’t think he really follows through on this boast, it would seem to beat odds with his final purpose: to show the Atlantic as a whole.  The opposition of modern sensibilities with those of the late medieval Atlantic undermines his critique of what he terms the “exclusionary force of the Western Civilizations Narrative”.  One of his fundamental claims argues for the multiplicity and melding of world-views to make a “pure” Atlantic.  In this vein the book seems to follow the work of Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, whom he quotes fairly often in his conclusion. Canizares-Esguerra, at least in his Introduction and Conclusion, writes with a style that is reminiscent of Armesto.  Arguing, without qualification or support, that sixteenth and seventeenth century Europeans were “obsessed with demons” (31). Granted demons were a part of the “religio-literary” (not sure if this works) iconography, but I think obsessed is too strong a word.  The last chapter of the book follows in this same vein, but I think, probably due to my sympathies, that it works better in that instance.&lt;br /&gt;
    Now for the rest of the book.   I have to point out first that I think its argumentative heart is in the last chapter. I often felt that he wasn’t saying anything differently throughout the book: “the people who colonized and conquered the Americas thought about their conquest in terms of an epic battle with diabolical forces, be they human, animal, vegetable, or mineral”.  That being said he does a great job of detailing his “Satanic discourse,” at least in terms of Puritan England and Roman Catholic Spain.  He claims that the “Satanic epic” colored the perceptions on many European countries (81), but they are conspicuously missing from the book. At least he’s honest about it in his title, but shouldn’t someone so interested in shaking up conceptions of the Atlantic World at least note the participation of others in his view of their world-view, or lack thereof.  Of course if he’s responding to a preponderance of such works then my criticism is withdrawn.&lt;br /&gt;
    A final note.  I may be part of his conceptualization of the Iberians/ Puritan Atlantic, but it is interesting to note that there are no entries in the index for Spain, Portugal, Iberia, or England.  A literary genre is his patient here, so I suppose I can’t fault him too much for sticking to his guns/&amp;nbsp;arqubuses?.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Jorge Canizares-Esguerra&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Puritan Conquistadors &lt;/em&gt;focuses on the similarities between the Spanish and English colonial experience in the Americas. Essentially they framed their conquest in the same terms, as a chivalrous struggle over Satan and his minions. To both civilizations, Satan had control over the indigenous populations and the new world was his fiefdom, a false paradise. The struggle was continuous and Satan was a moving target as the realities of the situation changed. For example, the English first saw the Spanish as demons before shifting their focus to the native population. The book maintains that the discourses were remarkably similar as both the Spanish and English made gardens out of the wilderness, maintaining a siege mentality and often speaking in millenarian terms. Of course, some differences are inherent, such as the Spanish being more inclusive with their religion, seeking converts as opposed to the English who saw their Christianity as more exclusive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first introductory chapter, the work covers the ongoing epic struggle to remove Satan from the New World. Subsequent chapters cover the shared understanding of demonology and shared perceptions of Satan working in the landscape. The book then shifts to the idea of the New World as a garden, to be turned from wilderness into a New Jerusalem or holy land. The last chapter examines how the subsequent literatures went their separate ways, portraying the English as Puritans and the Spanish as ruthless conquistadors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book suggests otherwise, that both cultures were remarkably similar in their conquests, at least theoretically. While they may have framed their conquests in similar terms, the reality of the situation is not discussed. What results is an intellectual history of the conquest that does not address the practicality of the situation, whether or not either culture actually practiced what their rhetoric suggested. Still, the book goes a long way to correcting any semblance of a Black Legend, arguing for an Atlantic paradigm, a Pan-American view of the conquest that shows both the English and Spanish came from Christian traditions that were more similar than different.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-1781739106710097234?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Although a pan-American examination of the various “Conquests” during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries can be refreshing and revealing, as Patricia Seed had shown, Jorge Canizares-Esguerra’s &lt;em&gt;Puritan Conquistadors &lt;/em&gt;falls short of that goal. The subtitle, &lt;em&gt;Iberianizing the Atlantic, 1550-1700&lt;/em&gt; does not offer much help in terms of explaining the book’s thesis and contents. Canizares-Esguerra argues that the English Puritans and Spanish Catholics in the Americas are often examined separately due to a modern idea of “proto-nationalism.” In short, the author implies, we tend to separate the conquests because we are reading history in retrospect, with a foreknowledge of the different paths colonial North America and colonial Latin American would eventually take. Ultimately, Canizares-Esguerra argues that “British Protestants and Spanish Catholics deployed similar religious discourses to explain and justify conquest and colonization: a biblically sanctioned interpretation of expansion, part of a long-standing Christian tradition of holy violence aimed at demonic enemies within and without”&amp;nbsp;(9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canizares-Esguerra’s premise is original and certainly worthy of further discussion. It also contain problems, one of which is that there were no “British” Puritans, as the Kingdom of Great Britain was not established until 1707. This may seem a quibble, but it is indicative of the pitfalls in comparative history—a seemingly small error may indicate a larger misunderstanding of very different contexts. He is quite right to assert that “theological differences manifested themselves concretely in the ways these two religious communities approached colonization” (15). These processes of conversion, after all, were binary opposites. The Conquistadors demanded conversion from every new willing or unwilling subject; the Puritans often denied salvation to their own kin, if sufficient evidence of God’s favor was not visible in the actions and words of the repentant. These are not small differences. Drawing on written and visual sources, Canizares-Esguerra claims that the “martial, epic tone” appears in the writings of both Spaniards and Puritans, and he has the sources to support the claim. What he does not adequately support, in my view, is his argument that the English Protestants and the Spanish Catholics, for their similar energies, shared the same interpretation of who Satan was and how he manifested his evil powers in the world. While conceding that his selected courses “emerged in unique social and political contexts and was devised o persuade particular audiences and to address social agendas,” he pointedly refuses to take these contexts into account. What is the historian’s job if not to incorporate social, cultural, and political contexts in the analysis of a source, in order to better explain the past? His reason? “I seek to reconstruct a worldview that is essentially violent, alien, and offensive to our modern sense of what is physically possible” (17). In other words, he offers no real reason. Perhaps he thinks the reader will be confused by the additional information. Or perhaps the various contexts of the writings would weaken his&amp;nbsp;argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not intend to be overly critical. Indeed, his comparative analysis of the English and Spanish “satanic epics” such as Edmund Spenser, John Milton, and Pedro de Quiroga would make a fine article on its own. “The satanic epic in England,” he writes, “thus came back full circle, back to Iberian models, because, paradoxically, the Puritans fully embraces every trope of the Iberian genre” (82). However, although he convincingly argues that many ideas of heaven, hell, angels, and demons were incorporated into both Protestant and Catholics works of literature, this does not equate to similar motivations for the colonization and conquest of the New  World. The English migrations to Virginia and Cape Cod (and it should be remembered that the &lt;em&gt;Mayflower&lt;/em&gt; landed a thousand miles off course; it was aiming for Jamestown) were not intended to conquer anybody. Cortes knew there were indigenous civilizations in the interior of Mexico, and sought to make them the King’s vassals. The initial flight of the Puritans, on the other hand, was extralegal; they were delighted on learning much of eastern Massachusetts had been cleared for them by pestilence (which they believed ordained by&amp;nbsp;God).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Canizares-Esguerra’s work misses the point. The reason the Puritans ad Conquistadors have traditionally been studies separately is because they represented very different approaches to the European exploration and settlement of the Americas. Although comparative history has its merits, &lt;em&gt;Puritans Conquistadors&lt;/em&gt;, to my mind, represents the dangers of pressing a comparison too&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Jorge Canizares-Esguerra&amp;#8217;s Puritan Conquistadors is brilliant.  Canizares-Esguerra makes two important arguments about the colonial history of the Americas.  First, the colonial Europeans shared a Christian fanaticism that transcended the gulf between Catholicism and Protestantism, and that ultimately derived from Spanish culture.  Second, the Spanish experience in the Americas is the normal and central experience in the colonial Americas, and that the British experience should be seen as peripheral &amp;#8212; and indeed, the British understood their colonial venture in terms of the Iberian experience.  Canizares-Esguerra demonstrates that for the Europeans in the Americas, the Devil was a very real figure, that the exorcism of demons from the New World was a common phenomenon for both Puritans and Franciscans, and that Europeans frequently understood the Americas to be an inverted Garden of Eden.  From this perspective, the European project in the Americas takes on the semblance of a holy war, as many contemporaries saw&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canizares-Esguerra&amp;#8217;s arguments are convincing.  It is clear that Christian fanaticism was a shared attribute among European colonials regardless of their denominational or national affiliation.  Canizares-Esguerra&amp;#8217;s evidence demonstrates that the British experience should not be seen as exceptional or isolated from the Continental experience, and certainly indicates that any lingering teleological ideas of a triumphal march towards enlightened democracy should be abandoned.  In the end, Puritan Conquistadors advances the project of Atlantic history into the realm of religious zeal and makes a compelling case for the importance of the Spanish experience in the Americas for the British understanding of the New&amp;nbsp;World.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Jorge Canizares-Esguerra’s book Puritan Conquistadors is a much different take on how the Americas were colonized. I have to admit I’m not real sure how I feel about this book. On the one hand it is an intensive examination of the religious aspect of the conquest but on the other hand that is really all there is. As this is our last book for the course I found it to be a kind of unceremonious end. Canizares-Esguerra’s take on conquest is interesting and he stresses that he is attempting to place the Spanish presence in the Americas more in the forefront of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; history. However, I do not believe he accomplished his goal. Now all be it the book is designed to revolve around religion there is just too much. I know that sounds strange but I think you need background and explore other aspects of the culture in order to understand the circumstances in which events happened. As I was reading this book I was just overwhelmed. If I knew nothing about the conquest and picked up this book I would have received a very jaded view of what happened in the Americas. I have this image in my mind of Spanish and English settlers running around thinking every plant they encountered was made of evil and the devil ran up to the boat to shake your hand once you crossed the Atlantic. I don’t want to be to down on the book it did have its merit. Seeing how the English and the Spanish understood each other on a religious level and how that influenced how they dealt with one another was interesting. But what Canizares-Esguerra set out to do just didn’t quite make it the argument was far to one sided. So in the end the comparison of the two cultures was interesting is showing the religious tensions which existed during the conquest but they were not in a context that provided the culture with a clear picture of what was truly going on and how actual people dealt with the circumstances they found themselves&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Patricia Seed’s &lt;em&gt;Ceremonies of Possession in Europe’s Conquest of the New World 1492-1640 &lt;/em&gt;is kind of a twist between landscape archaeology and nautical history, if that makes any sense to anyone reading this.  But don’t get me wrong I enjoyed the book; it was a fast read with interesting information.  How people physically possess land is an interesting concept when studying the past and as Seed explains no two really do the same thing. But back to the book…… Seed divided the book between the Spanish, English, Portuguese, and Dutch all prominent players in during the conquest of the Americas.  It is sometimes stated that Europe conquered the Americas, however, each country was made up of its own unique culture which influence not only how the interact with native people but how they posses the&amp;nbsp;land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I liked how Seed structured and organized the research which produced a nice flow to the work, there were a few aspects which I did not agree with.  The two chapters based on sea travel were a little broader than I thought the scope of the book was intended to make.  In these two chapters Seed goes into aspects which ranged around the world and the New  World was kind of lost until it resurfaced right at the end.  So in this aspect I would have liked to have seen more of a connection to the overall theme of the book.  A second aspect was the repetition I often felt like Seed was reiterating the same information again and again which did not seem necessary while you were&amp;nbsp;reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said I did enjoy the book in the past year I have done a lot of research concerning archaeological theory of landscapes and the English chapter really did ring true to what I have been looking at.  However, the book kind of left me wanting.  I felt like there should have been two more volumes to this book.  For instance I would have liked more information on how native peoples developed their concept of land possession.  And I know people say that Native Americans didn’t “own” the land but there are clear signs in the archaeological record of how communities defined their living space within the group and in relation to other groups they had to compete for resources against.  And secondly, Seed’s book covers the conquest but what happened afterward?  There has been a lot of research done on how American colonies organized themselves and the factors that influenced them.  As you can see with Seed the Europeans were highly influenced by the culture from their native land but once they got here you can see how a new culture grows out of the Americas.  Event the concept of the lock had a profound effect on how native peoples who were interacting with Europeans.  So in the end I found Seed’s book to be very interesting bringing together contrasting ideas that existed within Europe at the time of the conquest, however, I still would have liked to have seen&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Comparative history is rarely an easy task. At the very least, it usually involves the comprehension of several different languages and historiographies, at least some of which the historian will have only a partial grasp on. In some cases the historian must rely upon translations for primary sources, and the analytical conclusions of other historians in the secondary sources, without being able to criticize or deduce a great deal on his own. Beyond these rather basic problems, comparative history involves other potential pratfalls. As the author under consideration here, Patricia Seed, notes in the beginning of her study, different societies are, well, different, in their outlook, orientations, uses and deployments of language and social practices, and of course in their respective histories. A given society may be similar to or possess points of convergence with other societies- and there are always some points of similarity or convergence- but it is at these points of convergence that the historian must be especially careful. What can appear as a similarity might very well mask profound&amp;nbsp;differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patricia Seed looks at such points of convergence and difference in her book &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=bw9xPM3o_GwC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=ceremonies+of+possession&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=9FA4ygGK76&amp;amp;sig=wD1Iu-15_QQ52nVeIUME7LBvtqA&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=CpvDS_GwCYP58Aby_oXjCA&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=6&amp;amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;Ceremonies of Possession in European Conquest of the New World 1491-1640&lt;/a&gt;. An enjoyable read for its relative brevity and diversity of topics, some of her points hold up very well. The ways in which various European polities take possession- or rather, declare and legitimize their possession, primarily to themselves- appear as diverse as the various polities and their cultural histories. For each nation, Seed describes the particular ways of marking possession on a new (to Europeans of course) territory, and then details the historical/cultural background of those ways of marking possession. For instance, the English, she argues, employed little in the way of ceremony or official documentation to establish their dominion. Instead, the English built things: houses, fences, walls, demarcating their space and establishing their ownership. Not only did they expect these actions to register with each other as Englishmen, but they also expected them to send the same signals to other Europeans. That they did not was part, Seed argues, of the mutual- perhaps sometimes deliberate, but usually not- incomprehension over manners of establishing&amp;nbsp;possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some issues that came to my mind while reading this study, and they are reflective of the perils of comparative history I suppose. Why exactly did the English completely forgo ceremony? Was it a result of the Protestant Reformation? Could they not have combined both the active imposition of possession with the more ceremonially enacted rites similar to other nations? As for the Spanish, while the requiriemento is certainly an important part of things, the establishment of official political entities is doubtless moreso, and Seed seems unaware or uninterested in them. Also, I would have preferred a more fleshed-out proof of the influence of Islamic ideas of conquest and legality upon Spanish forms- while the intellectual milieu argument has some merits, I am always suspicious of it. Ideas do not simply float on ether back and forth- one needs solid locations, texts, instances of interpenetration. That said, her description of Islamic thought and practice was quite decent, I thought, for a non-specialist in the field. Finally, the importance of Papal authority could have used much greater emphasis; granted, it shows up in the conclusion as part of the common European imitation of Rome, but should have been incorporated in the body of the Spanish material. And as for overall questions, I would want to know a little more about how the conditions in the New World affected European approaches. Did the English act differently in, say, Honduras or the Caribbean than in North America? Obviously the Spanish greatly modify the requiriemento- do other nationalities do likewise? And perhaps greater attention could have been given to exactly why these ceremonies were enacted: obviously they are acts of self-legitimization, but more on how did they do this, and how the results could be transmitted back home would be helpful. In some cases it is quite obvious: the Portuguese and Dutch produced knowledge regimes that could translate to people back home as easily as those employing them in the New World or in organs of power.  And while it was not the point of the book, considering- where possible- indigenous responses would be very helpful and&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are doubtless other issues one could raise- those above are some that came to my mind because they involve things I know a little about. Also, while obviously outside the scope of the book, a continuation of this investigation into later forms of colonialism would be interesting: how much do these ceremonies change and evolve to suit new imperial conditions? Seeds obliquely mentions, for instance, the British in India, where very different conditions prevailed than in North America. How did the British adapt? And so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lieu of such an examination, we do have Eddie Izzard&amp;#8217;s take on later colonial ceremonies of possession- he in fact brings out the hilarity of a seemingly logical (to its enactors) way of taking possession with the incredulity of those being possessed; plus, the importance of violence as a completing and truly affirming agent is in evidence&amp;nbsp;here:&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Patricia Seed’s &lt;em&gt;Ceremonies of Possession in Europe’s Conquest of the New World, 1492-1640&lt;/em&gt;, achieves two goals simultaneously. First, the author has crafted an admirably brief synthesis of the motives and methods of the five European powers who played significant roles in the exploration and conquest of the Americas: the English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch. Second, and equally important, Seed delineates the various ways in which the European representatives (official and unofficial, as it were) in the New World interacted with and interpreted the motives of the others. She promotes a simple, common sense idea that nevertheless needed to be explicitly states, at least to this reader: the “ceremonies of possession” were not so much to impress the indigenous inhabitants, but to make a statement to their own governments and those of their&amp;nbsp;rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen this before, of course, with Cortes and the creation of the cabildo. The Veracruz cabildo was established to justify the presence and actions of Cortes and his men; it had nothing to do with the Mexica or Tlascalans. These ceremonies were sometimes preordained by the European governments, as in the case of Columbus, who had been given precise instructions. Others simply operated on the fly, as it were, and drew on their own experience and instincts to create ceremonies of possession where none existed. Seed’s point is clear: there was no “European” in North or South America, only an Englishman, Spaniard, et cetera. While the five European powers operated with similar tools (such as ships and cannons) “they did not share a common understanding of even the political objectives of military action” (3). While one is tempted to quip that similar problems can be witnessed in our own time, Patricia Seed’s comment serves to illustrate the truly unprecedented nature of the&amp;nbsp;Conquest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intersection of ceremony, language, and law enabled the infant colonial “institutions” to create both authority and legitimacy—two different but mutually dependent things with different manifestations form each colonial power. The English, according to Seed, found legitimization in the altering of the landscape; physical inhabitation and “improvement” of the land gave legitimacy to its acquisition (32). The Portuguese, on the other hand, had adopted many of the celestial navigation knowledge form the Arab World, and pioneered much knowledge of their own, alone among the powers of Europe. In short, the Portuguese believed they had intellectually earned the right to conquest&amp;nbsp;(133).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout, Seed writes in an easygoing, lucid style. It is not difficult to see why this book is now in its 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; printing. Even the geographical and astronomical explanations are written plainly, free of jargon. There is one problem with the book, however, although I am unable to determine its significance. Throughout, Seed claims that the ceremonies of possession were mutually unintelligible among the European colonial powers, de to difference in language and culture, among other things. This was no doubt true to a degree. After all, the Dutch viewed the world very differently than the Spanish. However, I wonder if she may not be oversimplifying in order to sustain her argument. Most educated Europeans of the time were at least moderately multilingual, and mariners, at least, have a language and vocabulary of their own—the reason the Genoese Columbus could make himself intelligible in any sailor’s bar in the Mediterranean. Just because Europeans approached possession and justification differently form other Europeans, and considered their methods along to be authentic, does not necessarily mean that the actions of others were completely baffling to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or does it? I don’t pretend to know. I do know that this book, on this reading at least, struck me as valuable and intriguing, and certainly worth re-examining in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://masalladelnapo.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/ceremonies-of-possession-in-europes-conquest-of-the-new-world-1492-1640.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://masalladelnapo.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/ceremonies-of-possession-in-europes-conquest-of-the-new-world-1492-1640.jpg?w=198&amp;#038;h=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;ceremonies-of-possession-in-europes-conquest-of-the-new-world-1492-1640&#34; width=&#34;198&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-71&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Patricia Seed’s &lt;em&gt;Ceremonies of Possession&lt;/em&gt; is streamlined and short and beautifully written; it was very well received when Cambridge published it in 1995.  The argument is simple.  Each of five colonial powers—the English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch—enacted their ceremonies of possession in ways that were culturally meaningful only for themselves. While it is certainly ambitious to attempt the comparative history of five colonial empires in 193 pages of text (much of which are footnotes), the book is successful and&amp;nbsp;thought-provoking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, to summarize the content.  In general, the English believed that the mundane action of building houses, planting gardens, and erecting fences gave them the right to possession. Seed somewhat homogenizes the English here.  For example, she equates the super-religious and persecuted Pilgrims at Plymouth with the mercenary Virginia Company at Jamestown.  She does not discuss the Pilgrim belief that God had divinely ordained their possession of Indian land, though this is what the Pilgrims themselves might have thought gave them the ultimate right to possession.  Also problematic, at one point, Seed oversimplifies, arguing that gardens lured the English to the New World while gold lured the Spanish&amp;nbsp;(26-27). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the English, the French enacted elaborately ritualized ceremonies of possession that took the form of parades culminating with planting the cross of Christ and the standard of France into Indian land.  Some Francophilia is evident here.  Seed describes these rituals beautifully, almost reverently, and focuses a great deal on the French focus on the consent of the Indians. The French, Seed says, desired allies won by love. She writes, “No other Europeans so consistently sought the political permission of the natives in order to justify their own political authority” (62).  Seed points out that often what the French sought was merely the appearance of consent.  But depending on the definition of consent, one can find it in the Spanish conquest as well.  What about consent of the Indian allies who made the Spanish Conquest possible (e.g. the several hundred thousand Tlaxcalans who went with Cortés’s much, much smaller group to conquer Tenochtitlan)?  Still, her point is well taken&amp;#8211;that during the ceremonies of possession themselves, the French focused much more on at least the appearance of native consent than did other&amp;nbsp;colonizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spanish, for example, used a ritualized text, the Requirement (the &lt;em&gt;Requerimiento&lt;/em&gt; in Spanish), to establish their legitimate dominion; here Seed follows Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas in tracing the Islamic roots of both the Requerimiento and the Spanish Conquest.  Here, there are traces of the Black Legend.  She sees the &lt;em&gt;Requerimiento&lt;/em&gt;—and the entire Spanish outlook when it is not obsessed with gold—as religious conquest in the name of God.  Darn, that Black Legend is persistently pernicious&amp;#8211;it rears up its ugly little head even in the best of books!  The Requirement, Seed argues, was the principal way that the Spanish established authority.  At one point, Seed says “Cortés’s carefully repeated statements that he had made the requirement known to the natives solidified his position as the undisputed representative of Spanish authority in the New World” (98).  But, Cortés’s authority was almost always disputed, and reading the Requerimiento was just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; ways that he tried to legitimize his&amp;nbsp;authority.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed’s sections on the Portuguese and the Dutch are very thoughtful and fairly convincing.  Apparently the Portuguese thought that the act of discovery, or really, of noting the latitude of a place previously unknown to Europeans, was what gave them the right to possession.  The Dutch, “sailing in the wake of the Portuguese,” have a similar concept, but since time has passed and more places have been measured, the Dutch think describing and mapping a new place should give them possession—as does the all-important trade licensed by the Dutch&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the conclusion of her book, Seed reduces all this to its simplest elements.  She writes: “Englishmen held that they acquired rights to the New World by physical objects, Frenchmen by gestures, Spaniards by speech, Portuguese by numbers, Dutch by description” (179).   What is excellent about &lt;em&gt;Ceremonies of Possession&lt;/em&gt; is that it shows the ways that Europe was not a homogenous entity—competing European colonizing powers understood possession on their own terms, in context of their own cultures. Possession seems to have been a cultural construction, intelligible only within the culture that claimed it.  Each European power really did have its own ideas about how to go about creating an empire that were rooted in the country’s own politics and folkways, so pointing out the ways in which European ceremonies of possession differ is&amp;nbsp;brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the book has its flaws. The big problem with the book is its reductionist tendency.  Admittedly, this is understandable in such a broad work of comparative history.  Still, downplaying, the construction of crosses (a practice which crossed cultural lines with total disregard for tidy categories) while highlighting the Requerimento (which the Spanish abolished in 1556) and the English love for hedgerows is problematic.  Reducing each country’s complicated notions of possession to essentialist elements that are unique to each culture skews the analysis somewhat. One also wishes Seed had not homogenized the English, the French, etc. quite so&amp;nbsp;much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the nation-state had not yet developed, and there was so much interpenetration of trade and elite culture in Europe, one wonders if there can have been so very much misunderstanding?  All of this mutual unintelligibility smacks of a problem in Latin American historiography—what Matthew Restall of the Lockhart School calls the Myth of (Mis)Communication.  Where other scholars have presumed mutual unintelligibility between Spanish Conquistadores and indigenous Mesoamericans, Restall sees the communication of many ideas, albeit in a translated and altered form. Isn’t it possible that European powers wanted to misunderstand each other so that they could invalidate each other’s claims and get more access to land, resources, and wealth?  Even more important, one wishes that Seed would have looked into indigenous people’s perceptions of all these ceremonies, and taken their own ideas about land rights into&amp;nbsp;account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed has written an important and thought-provoking book, and the idea of interpreting each colonizing power’s ceremonies of possession within its own cultural context is brilliant. Despite any quibbles, it is an incredibly useful analysis of a complicated block of time that brings historians one step closer to understanding the European colonization of the Western&amp;nbsp;Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Patricia&amp;nbsp;Seed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patricia Seed received her doctorate from the University of Wisconsin.   Seed worked at Rice University before moving to the University of California, Irvine.  Seed&amp;#8217;s other books include &lt;em&gt;To Love, Honor, and Obey in Colonial Mexico:  Conflicts Over Marriage Choice, 1574-1821&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;American Pentimento:  The Pursuit of Riches and the Invention of &amp;#8220;Indians&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;.  Most recently, Seed has published studies on the continuity of Iberian Arabic love poetry in the early Atlantic world, and a comparative study of treaty systems in Canada, New Zealand, and the United&amp;nbsp;States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ceremonies of Possession in Europe&amp;#8217;s Conquest of the New World,&amp;nbsp;1492-1640&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed&amp;#8217;s work is principally a study of the ceremonial practices Europeans employed to initiate colonial rule in the New World.  Seed&amp;#8217;s goal is to compare &amp;#8220;how Europeans created political authority over New World peoples, lands, or their goods between 1492 and 1640&amp;#8243; (3).  In the end, Seed finds that each European polity employed unique ceremonial practices because they had different conceptions of what political authority over the New World meant and the legal manner in which authority was demonstrated.  This book, then, is a comparative analysis of the early European experience in the New World, a legal history of European expansion, and a also a comparative intellectual&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed begins with an analysis of English possession in the New World.  Here, she argues that the English concept of possession relied on the cultivation of land and the construction of material boundaries.  In analyzing the French experience, Seed argues that the French employed highly ritualistic ceremonies involving alliances with native populations in order to claim legitimacy.  The Spanish used legal protocol in order to establish their right to conquest in the form of the &lt;em&gt;Requirimiento&lt;/em&gt;.  Seed argues that the &lt;em&gt;Requirimiento&lt;/em&gt; was both a continuation of martial protocol from Al Andalus and a specific invention of Spanish lawyers responding to the objections of Dominican friars.  Seed maintains that the Portuguese saw discovery as their legal right to possession of territories.  In the Portuguese understanding, their invention of the technology that enabled overseas expansion allowed a claim to whatever lands they discovered, whether or not any conquest or territorial possession occurred.  Finally, Seed turns to the Dutch, whom she finds likewise employed a notion of discovery, but with the added element that formally describing a region was necessary in order to lay claim to it.  Additionally, the Dutch concept of possession  was largely commercial, and in the Dutch understanding, the maintenance of trade routes and continued commercial interaction with the natives was necessary to claim&amp;nbsp;possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Seed&amp;#8217;s book offers a new look at the variety of the European experience in the New World.  Seed demonstrates that it is probably not correct to speak of a single European experience or goal in the New World, but to treat each European polity on its own&amp;nbsp;terms.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Patricia’s Seed’s book was a nice read.  My initial reactions to many of her statements ran the full gamut, depending on the situation described, from: “Ok, that makes since, so what.” To Wow, I never really thought about it that way.” She does seem to draw a line between the “mundanities” of the English, the more elaborate and ritualized expressions of possession of the French and Spanish, the intellectual culture of Portugal, and the scriptuous toponyming of the Dutch. I am not so sure that her delineation is fair.  She does a great job of laying out the intellectual history of all these ceremonies, I disagree with her separation of the systems of possession. She does try to point out the culturally specific significance of similar acts, it wasn’t always enough for me.  While I admit that the English didn’t have anything as regular as the Requirimento, there were definitely legalities and documents involved on a very mundane level.  Holes and fences were quite important as she rightly and effectively points out, but they do not utterly define the English experience of conquest.  It may simply be because I’m an English historian, but the scene that she portrays as a miscommunication between Queen Elizabeth and the ambassador from Portugal seems not so much an unintentional misunderstanding, but a rational choice to disagree.   Another point that she doesn’t seem to tease out is her assertion that these countries were actively and perhaps even to a degree unthinkingly pursuing an association with romanitas. This point is brought out in her conclusion, but is not something she really touches on in the rest of the&amp;nbsp;book.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; My blah, blahish complaining aside, I was pleased that I got to read the book.  I see it more as a history of the early modern evolution of nationalism in individual European countries than a history of possession.  Possession involves the taking of something from another, whether or not they are aware of it.  Eventually privation must be noticed in order for there to be a loss.  While she duly notes current reactions to these possessings, I wonder, despite its difficulty, whether or not a reading of indigenous sources might have strengthened her argument.  Again though this isn’t really her project, but just a thought I had.  In her defense though, I think she rightly points out, these ceremonies have less to do with indigenous denizens of the Americas, than affirming social structures of the colonizers.  There is not a lot of room for cultural plagiarism in this book which does make me wonder if this book would look similar is a place like colonial China, where, if I remember correctly, so many European spheres of influence overlapped regularly.  Her book was also fun in that it was well paced.  Since each of her chapters stands alone, I was able to stay pretty well attached to the&amp;nbsp;book. &lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Perhaps Ramon Gutierrez was attempting something cute and postmodern when he titled and arranged the contents of his book, &lt;em&gt;When Jesus Came, the Corn Mothers Went Away: Marriage, Sexuality, and Power in New Mexico, 1500-1846.&lt;/em&gt; Despite the promise of the title, perhaps only a third gets devoted to marriage and issues of power (allegedly focusing on &amp;#8216;how marriage structures inequality&amp;#8217; or something to that effect); if sexuality means &amp;#8216;sex,&amp;#8217; as it often does in these sorts of books, then it&amp;#8217;s interspersed in that one-third. Otherwise, there are a few discussions of the indigenous New Mexicans&amp;#8217; apparently prolifigate sexuality and sexual practices, including one brief, unsubstantiated paragraph promising that the Pueblo engaged in bi-sexual identification and other no doubt fascinating gender constructions suppressed by the evil&amp;nbsp;Franscicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, whatever promise the indigenous people hold- reconstructed voices, recovered narratives, yadda, yadda- Gutierrez either loses interest in or realizes that his tenuous evidence base can no longer be forced to support his constructions. As a result, most of the book ends up being a hybrid (ha ha) narrative/analysis of the history of Spanish conquest and colonisation of New Mexico. This is not, I think, necessarily a bad thing- some of the sections describing the history of Spanish activity were useful enough, at least in terms of giving an idea of what was going on in the Spanish world. However, the stated premises of the book- focus on the indigenous (hence the &amp;#8216;Corn Mothers&amp;#8217;), and marriage and sexual practice- strangely disappear for the bulk of the study. And when Gutierrez does examine his stated themes, he either suffers from a poor evidence base, as with the indigenous, or slips into tenacious moralizing, as with his descriptions of the Franciscans. Despite his valorous intentions of giving voice to the Pueblo people, depending upon far-flung anthropological studies and time-collapsed, mostly external, even deeply hostile, sources is probably not the best way to go about, one would think. Certain contradictions become evident: the indigenous swing between sexually promiscuous, the pueblos veritable havens of free love- yet with the intrusion of Spaniards into the narrative, it becomes clear that the indigenous women are not quite so free with their bodies as they initially appear. Granted, Gutierrez attempts a resolution, but the problem remains that all of his evidence for these attitudes flows from either contemporary Spanish accounts, or from modern-day anthropological/ethnographic studies. In describing the indigenous, chronology clearly does not matter: as with so many other writers, we are implicitly given to understand that non-European socities are refuges of the unchanging, their myths and rituals subsisting mystically outside the streams of time. Whether this is rooted in some metaphysical speculation or the simple utility of having a larger source base through ignoring dates is&amp;nbsp;immaterial.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://masalladelnapo.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/heb00531-0001-0011.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://masalladelnapo.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/heb00531-0001-0011.jpg?w=160&amp;#038;h=241&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;heb00531.0001.001&#34; width=&#34;160&#34; height=&#34;241&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-67&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ramón Gutierrez’s book &lt;em&gt;When Jesus Came, The Corn Mothers Went Away&lt;/em&gt; is a perfect example of why academics have turned away from structural analysis a la Claude&amp;nbsp;Levi-Strauss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a copy of Levi-Strauss sitting on my bookshelf.  I purchased it in undergrad for a course in symbolic anthropology, and I enjoyed the mental acrobatics it afforded me.  In my undergraduate course, each student completed a structural analysis of a myth.  I analyzed the Cherokee creation myth, and the story of Selu, the Cherokee Corn Mother.  The point of all this was not to teach me the secrets of ethnographic analysis, but to impart a bit of the history of theory.  After the papers were turned in, we learned about the flaws inherent in the structural method.  Oversimplification, the creation of misleading Cartesian dualisms, and the deceptive ease of the method are some of structuralism’s weaknesses that are most readily apparent in &lt;em&gt;When Jesus Came, The Corn Mothers Went Awa&lt;/em&gt;y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening chapter analyzes a Pueblo origin myth in classic structuralist style.  Earth and sky, male and female, corn and flint—the oversimplification into essentialist blocks that can be sorted into opposing piles of index cards (in true structuralist fashion) is maddening!  Also, throughout this chapter, the author assumes a 1:1 relationship between the present and the past that is problematic at best.  He addresses this issue in the introduction: “Skeptics can easily counter &amp;#8230; pointing out that symbols and practices can remain constant even though their meanings change; meanings can remain identical despite a radical change in the outward appearance of symbols and practices” (xxx).  While Gutierrez acknowledges this, he does nothing to reassure the reader that he has not missed the point&amp;nbsp;entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He catalogues what he sees as the wholesale destruction of Indian culture, for example, the replacement of solstice with Christmas, and the replacement of the Corn Mother with the Virgin Mary.  The whole book smacks of the reduction inherent in an &lt;em&gt;unsophisticated&lt;/em&gt; application of&amp;nbsp;Strauss.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the title itself is exceedingly annoying.  It speaks to the “Myth of Desolation” (the idea that the Spanish Conquest destroyed indigenous cultures wholesale) that Matthew Restall identifies in Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest as one of the biggest and most persistent problems in Latin American historiography.  In reality, the idea of a Native American Corn Mother still exists today.  Frustrated readers of Gutierrez would do well to read Cherokee author and poet Marilou Awiakta’s &lt;em&gt;Selu: Seeking the Corn Mother’s Wisdom&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1994.  The book is a testament to the vitality of the idea of the Corn Mother, and to her relevance to Native American spirituality&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Ramón Gutiérrez’s  &lt;em&gt;When Jesus Came, the Corn Mothers Went Away: Marriage, Sexuality, and Power in New Mexico, 1500-1846 &lt;/em&gt; is a compilation of ideas that while having good intentions went horribly wrong somewhere along the line.  As I was leading discussion for this week’s book I got the chance to read more information namely the reviews of the book, which I found puzzling.  But before I get into that lets talk about the book itself. When I starting reading the introduction I began thinking to myself “what is wrong this all these people who hate the book” judging by the introduction it had the makings of great book that I very much wanted to read, but then it stopped.  After the introduction Gutiérrez just took a major downturn and the Pueblo people were finally just lost along the way.  It he had stuck to the original concept it would have worked but instead he fixated on the Spanish and tried to cram as much information he could into the paragraph he was on and often failed to connect his concepts.  If the purpose of the book was to give a voice to the silenced or the forgotten I sure didn’t find it in his pages but ended up loosing it even more.  And let’s not forget the statistics.  By the time I got to that chapter the research he was using had lost all validity.  In anthropology they train us to use statistics and one thing my professor always taught us was just because there is a statistical correlation between two things does not mean it equals a relationship and Gutiérrez’s work is a prime example of how you can manipulate statistics to prove your point.  That is why I could not understand why every review I came to praised his groundbreaking research only a few which were written a few years later dealt with the obvious flaws. I know this not really supposed to be a platform for bashing the work, but even comments from Pueblo people were opposed to his ideas. After reading the commentaries that Steven posted on the blog page from people form Pueblo communities they were outraged by how their culture had been represented.  And I have to say I am with them Gutiérrez may have done his research on something but he very much limited what he was using in order to make his point which is not only offensive to historical scholarship but also to the people you are making accusations about claming to be bring a voice to their past.  In the end all I can say is that Gutiérrez did have a good concept in the beginning as seen by his introduction but something happened and he failed to live up to that, and I know see why every anthropologist who comes across this book is sent into a screaming&amp;nbsp;fit.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This is a very odd book.  Ramon Gutierrez wants to deliver to his readers a fair and balanced account of the colonization of the Pueblo world.  He begins somewhat admirably.  The first part of his book presents an ethno-historical account of the Pueblo world on the eve of the Spanish conquest. His use of later sources can be somewhat forgiven here since nothing remains outside archaeology to represent the Pueblo world before the coming of the Spaniards and their written record; if only he had used it. Yet he represents the observations of early twentieth century anthropologists as windows into the unchanging world of Pueblo society.&lt;br /&gt;
Had he then went on the do the same with Spain, the other “world” that he describes, this might be forgiven.  To be fair, he does offer a small account of the end of the Reconquista, but there is no “fictional” narrative constructed to help the story along, and it’s pretty much all downhill from here on in.  And what about the Corn Mothers, they pretty much disappear after the first few pages of the book.   They truly “go away”.  Perhaps this is also defensible, simply because the Pueblos in general pretty much disappear as well.  Once he gets into what seems to be his favorite part of the book, i.e. anything with lots of statistics on Spanish ideas of honor and marriage, the Pueblo people are irrelevant, only the progeny of his two worlds: the genizaros.&lt;br /&gt;
His sources are another source of befuddlement.  Among other things he claims to have defined “honor” for 17th century New Mexico through the citation of Hobbes’s Leviathan.  He also claims a more intimate knowledge of Pueblo life, often citing in support of his observations: “to this day.” As a corollary he even changes tense when he is supposedly offering an analysis of early modern New Mexico.  I am certainly not an expert, but imagine that understandings of honor have significantly changed in the intervening 300 or so years.   He also includes a façade of statistics which seems only to serve to “scientificize” his un-even analysis.&lt;br /&gt;
This book claims to give “vision to the blind,” but only ends up hiding the culture of the people who inhabited the Pueblos after the Conquest.  One would think that there would be more sources available through Spanish documents, but the best analysis of Pueblo culture that we have is reserved for the pre-Spanish era.  For Ramon Gutierrez the Corn Mothers leave, only to return when they can usefully serve as a stand-in for Pueblo&amp;nbsp;culture.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;For the first one hundred pages, the only problem I had with Ramon Gutierrez’s book was its cumbersome and slightly obnoxious title, &lt;em&gt;When Jesus Came, the Corn Mothers Went Away&lt;/em&gt;. I appreciated the author’s thoughtful introduction, which placed indigenous New Mexico in the &lt;em&gt;longue duree&lt;/em&gt; and describes how the climate changes of the last 12,000 years in turn shaped the geography and, much later, the demographic and cultural landscapes of would become a far northern corner of Spain’s New World Empire. For the most part, too, his chapter on “The Pueblo India World” served as a useful introduction to me, a non-specialist, on the collective worldview of the Pueblos, although his insistence on Pueblo women’s “voraciousness for semen” was disquieting—not because of the topic, but due to the boilerplate assumption that all Pueblo women were sex&amp;nbsp;addicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chapter on the Spanish Conquest, too, is valuable: the author rightfully places the Conquest in the larger context of the Reconquista, and his narrative of the various expeditions of Cortes, Coronado, and Onate are detailed, highly readable, and competently addressed. Again, Gutierrez succinctly—brevity being the soul of wit—and memorably incorporates the Spanish way of looking at the world into his narrative. “In death as in life,: he writes, “one’s honor in the community determined where one’s bones would rest in relation to sacred objects” (61). Similarly, his description of the Catholic Mass is informative and (not surprisingly) accurate, and Gutierrez does a fine job, in my view, in describing the institutionalization of the Church into the contours of daily life. His chapter on the political aspects of the Church—the Franciscans as instruments of political conquest as well as religious conversion—was&amp;nbsp;fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when it comes to describing the Spaniards, Gutierrez excels. His chapter on the Re-Conquest of New Mexico, however—that is, when discussing the Pueblos—descends into a maelstrom of unreadable statistics. Although the sentence “A geometric growth rate subjected to regression analysis and plotted on a logarithmic scale was then undertaken,” is doubtless comprehensible to someone, it is not I (172). This would be perfectly acceptable to me, as I make no claim to understand cliometric theory, but one wonders if the author is not simply inserting jargon to show off his vocabulary. Indeed, even at moments where I think I know where the author is going, such as his discussion of honor on page 177, Gutierrez takes the analysis in an unexpected direction. He is quite correct in his attempt to explain the concept of honor; in fact, I would argue it is essential, since it is one of those ambiguous concepts universally applied but only rarely mutually understood. “Honor,” he claims, “was first a value judgment concerning one’s social personality, a reflection.” Fair enough. Then: “Honor ultimately depended on brute force.” It is not far-fetched to accept that “honor” is something not intrinsic, but derives from one’s peers. (The literature on honor in American history is extensive.) But the assertion that honor depended on “brute force” is a dramatic one, and Gutierrez provides not a Pueblo or even Spanish source for justification, but Thomas Hobbes, taken completely out of&amp;nbsp;context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps ironically, given his subtitle, his chapters on marriage seem, to this reader at least, to be the weakest in the book. In his detailed descriptions of “dire impediments” to the institution of marriage, such as incest, adultery, and murder, one would not be off-base to conclude that there was no such thing as a Pueblo happy marriage. Furthermore, his “empirical evidence” concerning Pueblo and Spanish relations in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries concerns not written records—the building-blocks with which historians (though not anthropologists, of course) work, but 19 tables and charts, each one less intelligible than the last. Again, statistics have their place, and each scholar must use the evidence available to him or her. However, such a surfeit of statistics strikes me as evidence of laziness. There has got to be a better way of communicating the same information in a written, readable&amp;nbsp;form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutierrez’s work is, to repeat, not without its merits. Much of his &lt;em&gt;stated &lt;/em&gt;purpose remains worthy of emulation, or at least consideration. The same, however, cannot be said about the book’s&amp;nbsp;execution.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Jesus Came, the Corn Mothers Went Away&lt;/em&gt;, by Ramon Gutierrez, studies the effects of the conquest on the Pueblos of the greater New Mexico area. He uses marriage to provide a window into intimate relations and how they changed through the course of three and a half centuries. A complex web of interacting players negotiated symbols through marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gutierrez begins by assuming that every system of marriage in the era was a system of inequality. The first part of the book covers the 1600s, before the Spanish came. Serial monogamy and polygamy was the practice, and the inequality in society was largely between junior and senior men of society. Society was stratified and respect and other social debts perpetuated a cycle of indebtedness. The second part covers the conquest, where the Franciscan influence led to conflicting views and tensions among social and cultural groups and eventually led to a revolt. The Franciscans felt their role was to purge the indigenous peoples from practices they failed to understand and the friar control of marriage led to the previously established hierarchy falling apart. Indeed, the Franciscans held the political power in the era, something the crown would later challenge. The third and largest part covers the 18th century after the reconquest, where marriage was strictly supervised by the Spanish to promote inequalities. The third section focuses on a variety of topics, from the reconquest&amp;#8217;s empowering of the nobility to the importance of honor and virtue among both masculine and feminine sexuality to statistics about marriage and population growth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the book is divided into three sections, it might be better viewed as two. In the first, the Spanish and Pueblos continually negotiated cultural customs and this part does more to break down traditional myths than many other works. The second half of the book focuses more on marriage and, unfortunately, more on the Spanish. Both are useful in understanding the conquest. Much of the most valuable parts of the book, however, have nothing to do with marriage and sexuality, sparse topics in the first two brief sections. For example, Gutierrez claims that the Franciscan&amp;#8217;s failure to prevent Apache raids and drought led to the loss of belief in their spiritual power and eventual revolt. In the final pages, he also provides valuable insight as to how encroachment from other colonies, the United States and France, led to the crown taking control of New Mexico from the church. Indeed, the book is a decent study of marriage and sexuality and a more poignant one on power.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-6227207449206825004?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been to New Mexico, but it never occurred to me that it might have an interesting past.  &lt;em&gt;When Jesus Came, the Corn Mothers Went Away&lt;/em&gt; suggests that it does.  Gutierrez tells a colonial narrative unlike any other I&amp;#8217;ve encountered.  The establishment of a Franciscan theocracy, a successful native revolt, a reconquista, and the eventual position of importance in the great game of European empire-building in North America is a gripping tale, and I put the book down wanting to know more.  In part, though, my desire to know more stems from a sense of disappointment in the book&amp;#8217;s narrow focus on marriage.  Part &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;III&lt;/span&gt; seems especially entrenched in a host of statistical analyses that do anything but paint a portrait of the society of eighteenth-century New Mexico.  While I actually found these analyses intriguing, ultimately I had trouble incorporating them into a broader understanding.  With that in mind I think Gutierrez may have been better served by writing a book solely about the social history of eighteenth-century New Mexico, using marriage customs as the centerpiece of a larger&amp;nbsp;discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of its merits and flaws, &lt;em&gt;When Jesus Came, the Corn Mothers Went Away&lt;/em&gt; has altered the way I think about the colonial experience in North America and the trajectory of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; history.  In particular, if I ever find myself teaching high school again and stuck with an American history class, I may very well start the year by exploring the Spanish colonial experience in California, New Mexico, and Florida before ever getting into the extent of Massachusetts&amp;#8217;s awesomeness and Tea Parties and democracy and&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Richard&amp;nbsp;Trexler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Trexler lived from 1933 until 2007.  Trexler received his &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt; from Baylor University, and earned his PhD in 1964 from the University of Frankfurt.   Trexler worked at the University of Texas and the University of Illinois, but in 1978 he moved to &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SUNY&lt;/span&gt; Binghamton, where he worked until his&amp;nbsp;death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trexler was principally a scholar of Renaissance Florence, but worked on many areas of Early Modern and Renaissance Europe.  In addition to &lt;em&gt;Sex and Conquest&lt;/em&gt;, Trexler is best known for his three-volume study &lt;em&gt;Power and Dependence in Renaissance Florence&lt;/em&gt;.  All told, Trexler wrote or edited nearly twenty books and authored over sixty scholarly&amp;nbsp;articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sex and Conquest: Gendered Violence, Political Order, and the European Conquest of the&amp;nbsp;Americas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trexler&amp;#8217;s work is principally a study of the &lt;em&gt;berdache&lt;/em&gt;, a poorly understood figure nearly ubiquitous in indigenous American cultures.  Trexler&amp;#8217;s goal is to &amp;#8220;describe and analyze American homosexual practices and the male transvestism often associated with them, as the Iberians heard of these practices&amp;#8221; (2).  In the end, Trexler finds that the &lt;em&gt;berdache&lt;/em&gt; is an important component of a political and social order based on gendered violence.  In this order, male sexual domination of women, other males, and children was an instrument of social and political authority.  Such domination manifested itself in both the threat and the execution of sexual&amp;nbsp;violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assigning a fundamental social and political role to sexual violence is a bold and contentious analysis.  To support his claim, Trexler draws on the ancient and medieval pasts in the European and Mediterranean worlds.  Trexler devotes several chapters to demonstrating that gendered violence was common in the ancient world, even if its prominence is often obscured in the evidence.  Trexler maintains that homosexual acts of violence were prominent in ancient martial experiences and a normal component of conquest.  Soldiers brought such behaviors home with them, and over time they became an accepted component of domestic life.  Trexler points to the Islamic world as the inheritor of these practices, but he also strives to find examples in medieval Europe, and even presents evidence of homosexual violence in modern&amp;nbsp;wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Trexler&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Sex and Conquest&lt;/em&gt; provides a useful discussion of the construction of human sexuality and the role of sexuality in creating social and political order.  While many of Trexler&amp;#8217;s assertions are provocative and even confrontational, this study demonstrates that sexuality, violence, and social order need to be examined as parts of a whole, not as isolated components of the human&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Richard C. Trexler. &lt;em&gt;Sex and Conquest: Gendered Violence, Political Order, and the European Conquest of the Americas&lt;/em&gt;. Cambridge, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; : Polity Press,&amp;nbsp;1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete Sigal. &lt;em&gt;From Moon Goddesses to Virgins: The Colonization of Yucatecan Maya Sexual Desire&lt;/em&gt;. Austin: University of Texas Press,&amp;nbsp;2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began this pair of readings with some trepidation. Sex(uality) and gender are popular, buzz-worthy terms, which means that they are often thrown into scholarship as necessary elements, with the obligatory nods to Foucault or Butler and the like. A few buzzwords- gender, body, performance, blah blah- and the author moves on to the topics she actually cares about and knows. These books, while possessing their own problems, are not perfunctory examinations of gender and sexual practice, but rather make these categories central, even totalizing, to their analysis. That said, the two books differ pretty dramatically in their basic approaches and their usefulness and historical accuracy. I will begin with Trexler&amp;#8217;s book, the more seriously problematic of the two it seemed to me (and I apologize if I sound particularly critical- probably I should include more positive analysis but sometimes criticism is easier and&amp;nbsp;cathartic&amp;#8230;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trexler takes the wide view, constructing a bold world of reified and essentialist &amp;#8216;Americans,&amp;#8217; &amp;#8216;Europeans,&amp;#8217; even &amp;#8216;Asians&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Africans,&amp;#8217; as well as- of course!- &amp;#8216;Muslims,&amp;#8217; the sufferers par exemplar of  &amp;#8216;harem [sic] culture&amp;#8217;. Having already discovered, via his reading of Foucault and Freud, what he is looking for, he proceeds to find it beginning with the ancient Persians (via Herodotus[!]) and ending with nineteenth century American anthropologists. In between cultures, religions, polities, and the like collapse before his all-consuming vision of things. Buggery=(more or less) state formation. This of course is an expression of power (someone read his Foucault!), which is pretty much the same everywhere. This totalizing discourse is supported by a highly impressionistic use of sources, both when setting the &amp;#8216;European&amp;#8217; and Iberian/Islamic background- the two areas with which I am most familiar. His construction of Islamic sexuality and gender understanding was especially painful; I was reminded that Said&amp;#8217;s critiques in &lt;em&gt;Orientalism&lt;/em&gt;, while sometimes over the top and flawed, can also be all too pertinent. Amazingly, Trexler quite confidently fixes &amp;#8216;Islamic&amp;#8217; (read: Arabo-Islamic/Perso-Islamic) understandings and practices of gender and sexuality via a handful of studies from Morocco, and one from Medina. That, and a dubious source on Jewish sexuality, is the greater part of his sweeping discourse of Islamic mores, which in turn back up his contentions for Iberian&amp;nbsp;culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving in the Americas, my knowledge of the sources is of course much less, but even a cursory examination reveals the far-flung impressionistic approach Trexler takes. This in itself would not necessarily be a problem. One cannot fault a scholar for the paucity of his sources if they are simply unavailable. One can however fault him for building castles in the air and declaring them to be the absolute case; one can fault him for an inability or unwillingness to acknowledge what is surely a more complex situation than a universal mode of being a berdache that Trexler seems to uncover. Further, even within the problems of his use of sources, the reduction of sexuality and human activity that Trexler proposes is seriously problematic on its own, to say the least. That said, it seems likely that much of his discourse is accurate enough- certainly sexuality and gender were and are powerful means of communicating, conveying, and imposing power relationships. However, that is not the sum of it, and the ways in which gender and sexuality are expressed, the extent to which they are used, and so on, varies from society to society, a fact that ought to be kept in constant mind, especially in the presence of apparent external&amp;nbsp;homogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Trexler jumped from Persia to Cuzco with apparent ease, Sigal has the immense (in light of Trexler at least) virtue of largely confining his examination to post-conquest, colonial Mayan society. He further confines- largely- himself to a select grouping of texts, which he presents as simultaneously representative of pre-conquest/colonial Mayan culture as well as colonial &amp;#8216;hybridity&amp;#8217; (Sigal&amp;#8217;s favorite, constantly recurring concept). Sometimes it is very unclear where on this spectrum a given text or interpretation falls- perhaps a deliberate strategy on Sigal&amp;#8217;s part. While he does in fact take into account &amp;#8216;external&amp;#8217; history (despite his prerequisite disavowal of &amp;#8216;positivism&amp;#8217; and his deliberate adherence to the world of the texts), much of his interpretation does stay within the confines of his texts, which leads to both positive- a grounded, particular path that avoids the pitfalls of sweeping generalities and floating cultural signifiers and interpretations- and the less positive. Sometimes the way in which Sigal is extracting a given meaning from a text is very unclear; in a few chapters I found myself completely lost while trying to follow Sigal&amp;#8217;s often torturous logic and prose style. The blame cannot all be upon Sigal, I ought to note- no source is &amp;#8216;transparent,&amp;#8217; and Sigal&amp;#8217;s certainly are not. This makes appraising his interpretations and claims to extract gender and sexual practice all the more&amp;nbsp;difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take more time and space than I wish to spend to examine each of Sigal&amp;#8217;s arguments and constructions of Mayan identity and response to colonialism. Some sections I found quite convincing and useful; others were much more dubious, or far too hedged upon expansive treatments of Lacan or Freud and too little Mayan or Spanish material, the evidentiary material receding into the background, floating in the air like the floating phallus Sigal spends a great deal of time elucidating. Most troubling, I sometimes thought that Sigal believes that he has &amp;#8216;decoded&amp;#8217; Mayan society in its whole via his elucidation of gender and sex; that everything can be collapsed into this one &amp;#8216;thing,&amp;#8217; hinged upon sexual practice. Hence, by &amp;#8216;desire&amp;#8217; only sexual (in an apparently very specific though never actually specified sense) desire is meant- but surely we can allow for the existence of other permutations and means of desire without collapsing them all into (presumably physically, actively) sexual desire? Likewise with other issues, whether reactions to colonial situations or understandings of the &amp;#8216;sexuality&amp;#8217; of the gods. Certainly, sexuality and gender are central issues in any culture, and certainly sex and gender become &amp;#8216;tools&amp;#8217; of the sorts of construction and moves of power that Trexler and Sigal have in mind; but I would suggest that things- especially things outside of the modern European context- are in fact rather more complex than that. But that&amp;#8217;s a whole other&amp;nbsp;post/book/career&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Richard Trexler’s &lt;em&gt;Sex and Conquest &lt;/em&gt;and Pete Sigal’s &lt;em&gt;From Moon Goddesses to Virgins &lt;/em&gt;offer two very (very) different looks about how sex played a part in the Conquest.  When the Spanish encountered the cultures of the New World a fare amount of cultural shock occurred, to say the least.  However, the strict moral code that the Catholic faith brought across the Atlantic did not conform to any conception of how the native people of the Americas acted.  For this weeks topic I think it was important to read both of these books.  While the topic of the books was the same the way in which the authors approached it was radically different.  And if we had not read both it would have been hard to understand how historians have approached the topic of&amp;nbsp;sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reading the books it became clear that I found Sigal’s approach more appealing.  In Sigal’s book he took a more well rounded look at sex in both the native culture as well as during the conquest.  Allowing the reader to compare and contrast how aspects changed and what was lost by the Spanish enforcement of acceptable behavior.  Trexler outright acknowledges in his book that he did not want to dive into the historical background of aspects of native traditions and rituals.  As an anthropologist I like to have the details picking up a story in the middle right before everything changes is not how I like to learn about&amp;nbsp;culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t get me wrong Trexler was not all bad.  But he had a motive for writing the book he wanted to examine how power and dominance are expressed through sex. For a good third of the book Trexler looks at other cultures and how sex and violence occur.  The rest of the structure of the book made me feel like he could have plugged in any culture instead of the Americas.  But maybe that is the point that this form of violence exists in every culture and he used this book to not only look at how this has occurred but the implications it can have for current times as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex is a part of human culture no matter what part of the world or time period.  However, humans express their cultural rituals in various ways.  As we have seen in these two works the native people of the Americas developed sexual rituals that were bizarre to Spanish causing them to react violently.  By reading these two works we can see how Trexler analyzes the darker side of sex and violence.  While Sigal takes a more positive look incorporating the evolution of the traditions from there incorporation in the culture to their evolution during the contact period. However, by reading both books at the same time we not only see how things occurred in the past but the different tones the topics can take on based on the message the author is trying&amp;nbsp;relate.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Four-and-twenty Highland men&lt;br /&gt;
Came from the Carron side&lt;br /&gt;
To steal away Eppie Morrie&lt;br /&gt;
Cause she wouldn&amp;#8217;t be a bride, a bride&lt;br /&gt;
She wouldn&amp;#8217;t be a&amp;nbsp;bride&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;ve taken Eppie Morrie&lt;br /&gt;
And a horse they&amp;#8217;ve bound her on&lt;br /&gt;
And they&amp;#8217;re away to Carron side&lt;br /&gt;
As fast as horse could gang, could gang&lt;br /&gt;
As fast as horse could&amp;nbsp;gang &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haud away from me, Willie&lt;br /&gt;
Haud away from me&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#8217;s not a man in all Strathdon&lt;br /&gt;
Shall wedded be by me, by me&lt;br /&gt;
Shall wedded be by&amp;nbsp;me &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then mass was sung and bells were rung&lt;br /&gt;
And they&amp;#8217;re away to bed&lt;br /&gt;
And Willie and Eppie Morrie&lt;br /&gt;
In one bed they were laid, were laid&lt;br /&gt;
In one bed they were&amp;nbsp;laid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;s kissed her on the lily breast&lt;br /&gt;
And held her shoulders twa&lt;br /&gt;
But aye she gat and aye she spat&lt;br /&gt;
And turned to the wa&amp;#8217;, the wa&amp;#8217;&lt;br /&gt;
And turned to the&amp;nbsp;wa&amp;#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wrestled there all through the night&lt;br /&gt;
Before the break of day&lt;br /&gt;
But aye she gat and aye she spat&lt;br /&gt;
But he could not stretch her spey,&lt;br /&gt;
He could not stretch her&amp;nbsp;spey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haud away from me, Willie,&lt;br /&gt;
Haud away from me&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#8217;s not a man in all Strathdon&lt;br /&gt;
Shall wedded be by me, by me&lt;br /&gt;
Shall wedded be by&amp;nbsp;me &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then early in the morning&lt;br /&gt;
Before the light of day&lt;br /&gt;
In came the maid of Scallater&lt;br /&gt;
In gown and shirt alone, alone&lt;br /&gt;
In a gown and shirt&amp;nbsp;alone &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get up, get up, young woman&lt;br /&gt;
And take a drink with me&lt;br /&gt;
You might have called me maiden&lt;br /&gt;
For I&amp;#8217;m as whole as thee, as thee&lt;br /&gt;
For I&amp;#8217;m as whole as&amp;nbsp;thee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in there came young Breadalbane&lt;br /&gt;
With a pistol on his side&lt;br /&gt;
O, come away, Eppie Morrie&lt;br /&gt;
And I&amp;#8217;ll make you my bride, my bride&lt;br /&gt;
And I&amp;#8217;ll make you my&amp;nbsp;bride &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go get to me a horse, Willie&lt;br /&gt;
Get it like a man&lt;br /&gt;
And send me back to my mother&lt;br /&gt;
A maiden as I came, I came&lt;br /&gt;
A maiden as I&amp;nbsp;came&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Sex and Conquest was a strange book.  Trexler, came off to me (certainly, no pun intended) as a very excited writer.  I cannot remember when I have seen so many exclamation points in a given book.   While his organization seems fairly clear, the argument seems to be a little muddled.  Exactly what is he trying to prove?  I get that he is analyzing the role of the berdache as a focus for his study of the sexuality of the Spanish conquest and he definitely makes some interesting (and often blunt) points about this role.  His analysis is quite skillful in an acrobatic and flexible sort of way (again, no pun intended), but I’m not sure that, at this point anyway, that I’m entirely convinced.  Convinced of what you might ask?  There, at least to my mind, seems to be a subtext throughout challenging modern and often uncritically inherited notions of gender and, at least for him, its intrinsic partner sexuality.  And there often are unveiled references to modern practices which emulate aspects of conquest society in the regions he discusses. This is fine and probably needs to be shaken up often, but I’m not sure what it adds to his book, especially since it is mixed in throughout.  In his excitement to make a point about sexuality and all its social implications, he sometimes left me a sentence behind, a passive reader.  I’m glad for the opportunity to read the book, as I am with any work that seriously treats violence and gives me a deeper, more penetrating understanding of its role in societies, and now only hope that I can get some of it out of my&amp;nbsp;head….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; From Moon Goddesses to Virgins seemed to be a compliment to Sex and Conquest.  Whereas Trexler emphasized the European approach to sexuality in the Americas, Sigal tries to tease out the ways in which sexuality was experienced by the Maya both before and after Spanish authorities tried to change sexualized practices.  This book was my first experience with psycho-analytic thought used in a historical setting and so I am not quite sure what to make of it.  I know that I thought Trexler’s argument was complicated, but it was nothing compared to that if Sigal.  This book also came off more clinical than Trexler.  I don’t know if it was the different style or simply the vocabulary, but Sigal’s argument definitely seemed more technical and theory driven than that of Trexler.  It’s nice, in a way, to see someone who is able to break with the “let’s use a theory of modern western psychology” on a non-western society, but being so different also means being less intelligible.  It could be that I simply don’t get what Sigal is trying to do here because my mind is so inscribed with Freudian conceptions of sexuality, but the latter part of the book seemed paradoxically the most direct, but also the most confusing.  A non-gendered phallo-centric world is certainly not something I have any familiarity with and in this respect, it was a good&amp;nbsp;read.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best result of these readings was that the way I think about sexuality will never be the same.  I will never look at a person bent over the same way after reading Trexler.  At the same time I think that Sigal’s book might require another go-through at some (indeterminate) time in the future.  Together these books give it to you both ways: sex as a mechanism for control and sex as an experience of control and&amp;nbsp;subversion.  &lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Conquest and colonization entail more than battles with swords and obsidian points, more than establishing a cabildo and asserting legitimacy.  There follows a second, darker conquest: the colonization of sexual desire, the body, and finally the mind&amp;nbsp;itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete Sigal’s From Moon Goddesses to Virgins: The Colonization of Yucatecan Maya Sexual Desire (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2000), reveals that this reality of the conquest was fascinatingly complicated.  Maya forms endured and persisted and were hybridized, colonizing the gods of the colonizers even as the Maya were colonized.  The Spanish tried to inscribe their notion of sin onto Maya culture, but it took a long time—and even when it did, sin was something that displeased the gods, not something that was, for lack of a better word, sinful.  This is just one example of the hybrid colonial culture that was created amongst the Maya and the Spanish.  The Virgin Mary Moon Goddess was a hybrid creation of the Maya, where they reinscribed the Catholic mother of Jesus as a powerful goddess. This reinterpretation of Mary allowed preconquest ideas about divinity to persist into the colonial era. Moon Goddesses deals very sensitively with the relationships between sex, war, power, conquest, and&amp;nbsp;colonialism.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Trexler’s Sex and Conquest: Gendered Violence, Political Order, and the European Conquest of the Americas (Ithaca &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt;: Cornell University Press, 1995) is much more heavy-handed.  He fixates on the state, uses words like “sissy” (Trexler xi) and makes sweeping generalizations far too often (e.g. “warfare as the incubator of civil institutions” (Trexler 140). Trexler presents man-man sexual acts in the way that the Spanish would have understood them.  And he does an excellent job of linking war and rape with ideas of power and masculinity.  But Trexler’s subject is basically the berdache.  He says that his “first and primary purpose is to describe and analyze American homosexual practices and the male transvestism often associated with them, as the Iberians heard of these practices during their original contacts with the many peoples of what would come to be called Latin America” (Trexler 2).  Yet he includes the Zuni (Trexler 116,120,123), the Iroquois (Trexler 129) and any number of other groups scattered across the hemisphere.  He also says the berdache is a ubiquitous institution across native America (Trexler 121), but this is debatable.  Sigal, for example, discusses Trexler (whom he compliments) but Sigal says “there is only scattered evidence of a Maya equivalent to the berdache” (Sigal 202).  Additionally, Trexler asserts, compared with Europeans, an “at least allegedly more misogynistic attitude of Amerindian males toward their females” (Trexler 172), which is a problematic notion at best.  But Trexler is certainly correct that “Europeans had long imagined conquest in gender terms” (Trexler&amp;nbsp;175). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigal reveals that gender is so much more complicated than all this!  Sigal’s study of Maya gender in the colonial period reveals that people did not have an identity based on sexuality—gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual, etc…  In reality, boundaries were more fluid and complex.  Maya curing rituals depict tarantula representing a vagina might use its penis to cure the sick.  The Moon Goddess is the perfect example of a complicated, fluid, classification-defying, powerful, gender-blurring goddess.  And a goddess she&amp;nbsp;was!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trexler also says that in the indigenous world, “ high was male and low was female” and he uses the Book of Chilam Balam to show that the Itzá subordinated the Maya and became “older brother” (Trexler 81).  But Sigal uses the same sources and shows us that the Moon Goddess was a colonizing goddess from Itzá, operating in a parallel gender structure in which her power was equal to or greater than the male gods who she had sex with (and sometimes penetrated).  The Moon Goddess was female (although she played with gender quite a bit!), she was powerful, she penetrated other gods.  One could even argue that she penetrated the Virgin Mary, as they merged.  All of this is so much more complicated than the macho, misogynistic, male-homosexual-rape-obsessed world that Trexler describes.  At the end of the day, much of history is messy and complicated, and cannot be packaged into neat conceptual&amp;nbsp;categories.   &lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Richard Trexler&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Sex and Conquest &lt;/em&gt;analyzes Mesoamerican homosexual practices and transvestism to shed light on the conquest. To set the stage he examines the European background where sodomy was used as a display of power and punishment to create effeminacy. He then studies sodomy in the context of Moorish / Spanish struggles in Iberia before moving to the Spanish contact with America, where the conquistadors often used gender issues to portray indigenous peoples as outsiders. He then turns to native transvestism, showing that it had a more permanent role in America, often religious, before examining attitudes towards transvestism. The summary focuses heavily on the violence inherent in sodomy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, violence is an underlying theme of the book. Male captives, in both the European and American traditions, were often raped as a display of conquering power and to effeminate the conquered. Even in cases not involving warfare, it was usually connected with issues of power and dominance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book also maintains that the Spanish were familiar with homosexuality at contact. Though it perhaps took on a wider variety of roles in the Americas, it was not as major of a difference in culture to the degree that the Spanish used it to portray indigenous peoples as outsiders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The portrayal of homosexuality makes it seem almost normal at the time, in both America and Europe, and indeed throughout most of human history. Today it is given almost an outsider status, even to the point where the infrequent uses of sodomy in warfare are seen as exceptions and not the rule. An excellent additional chapter, or perhaps book, would trace the attitude towards sodomy from the conquest era to the present, as the book does mention negative attitudes towards sodomy, albeit sometimes hypocritical, on the part of the Catholic Church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The underlying themes of Pete Sigal&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;From Moon Goddesses to Virgins&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, focus more on the differences between Spanish and Maya sexuality. Sexual desire among the Maya was usually framed around complex rituals whereas the Spanish constructed it frequently around sin, although the reality of the situation often suggested otherwise. Sexuality in the culture of the Maya was often used to communicate with the gods, whereas the focus was on purity with the Spanish. Sex was more public with the Maya and more private with the Spanish. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of the argument revolves around the role of the moon goddess and her varied roles. Promiscuous, she was important in creating lineages. The Spanish attempted to replace her with the Virgin Mary. The results, as were most attempts to replace Maya sexuality with Catholic values, created a hybridized version of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, the most valuable part of the book is the idea that the complete spiritual conquest never happened, which suggests that complete conquest failed to happen in other cases. &lt;em&gt;From Moon Goddesses to Virgins &lt;/em&gt;sees colonialism as a renegotiating of power. Although the Spanish held the upper hand in the negotiations, they did not make Spaniards out of the indigenous peoples. The book&amp;#8217;s claim that the conquest created a mestizo race of the mind is well said.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-201140279335919757?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;Synopsis&lt;br /&gt;
Pete Sigal, From Moon Goddesses To Virgins: The Colonization of Yucatecan Maya Sexual Desire, Austin: The University of Texas Press,&amp;nbsp;2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete Sigal’s From Moon Goddesses To Virgins: The Colonization of Yucatecan Maya Sexual Desire is a stunning portrait of the way that the preconquest Maya discourse of desire adapted during the colonial period to create something that was not entirely Mayan, and not entirely Spanish, but something new and truly colonial. Sigal writes, “the Maya ethical system changed into a hybridized form, one in which the two systems (Maya and Spanish) did not replicate either of the prior two”&amp;nbsp;(xiv).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning the project searching for the Moon Goddess, Sigal ended up finding a hybridized Virgin Mary.  Sigal writes: “The Virgin Mary Moon Goddess of the colonial Maya people was a virgin, a bisexually active woman, and perhaps a bisexually active man.  I look at this sentence and believe that something has gone awry, and indeed something has.  The categorizations and boundaries that modern Western peoples prescribe for sexual acts cannot be applied for the colonial Maya …  and the Virgin Mary Moon Goddess, rather than embodying a single sexual identity, signified this search for understanding: she symbolized the hybrid sexual discourse of the colonial Maya” (241).  This is Sigal’s subject—the creation and performance of a hybrid.  Importantly, Sigal deals with shifting mental processes and cultural frameworks, not actual sexual practices at any given&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subject is messy, fascinating, and challenging—and Sigal’s analysis of it is excellent.  The first chapter introduces the Moon Goddess and the subject matter of the book.  We learn that the Moon Goddess was a very powerful goddess, with power paralleling or exceeding that of the other, mostly male gods who were her sexual partners (5).  The Moon Goddess represents many things at once.  She is the goddess of life and death, the mother, the goddess of sex, and what Sigal terms “The Goddess of Colonialism,” who spread out from Itzá during Maya expansion in the preconquest era (5). Chapter Two lays the groundwork for the cultural similarities between the Maya and the Spanish that allowed for hybridization during the colonial period, when the Maya reinscribed their own meanings onto the gods of the colonizers.  Sigal says that the Maya did not classify or categorize sex, and it did not create an identity like a sexual orientation.  But they did associate sex and gender with warfare and the political order, and sex had the power to creative normally and destructive in&amp;nbsp;excess.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter Four is titled “Fornicating with Priests, Communicating With Gods,” and it reexamines an anonymous 1774 petition that describes the inappropriate behavior of four secular priests whom the Maya parish wishes to censure in favor of their Franciscan priest, who presented an alternative to the power of the encomenderos.  This is significant because it shows the Maya writers’ understanding and use of Spanish gender norms and Spanish clerical celibacy.  By the late colonial period, the Maya are using the tools of the colonizers against them&amp;nbsp;(65).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most fascinating portions of the book deal with the melding of the Moon Goddess with the Virgin Mary in Chapter Five.  Preconquest desire for the Moon Goddess transforms into Colonial desire for the Virgin Mary Moon Goddess, who is truly neither but shares attributes of both.  After this chapter, there are explorations of the relationships between blood, truth, lineage, and the right of a ruler to rule.  Also, the author explains the role of ritual bloodletting of men and women in the maintenance of the community and in the feeding and maintenance of the gods’ pleasure.  Very interesting is Sigal’s discussion of the ways that Maya ritual blurred gender boundaries—a daughter might have a penis (171), men might be penetrated (168), and the phallus itself can be understood as a transsexual phenomenon (178).   Sigal makes the point that Western Freudian notions of “penis envy” simply do not fit this&amp;nbsp;picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigal’s use of theory is quite sophisticated.  He does not merely throw out a name so that he may put Foucault in the endnotes. Rather, Sigal engages and wrestles with ideas in their contexts—and this includes taking the time to prove that Freudian analysis and the concept of Oedipus does not fit the Mayan context.  What is relevant, and critically important to his project, is Sigal’s use of Foucaultian and Lacanian notions of the relationship between power and sex to illuminate his&amp;nbsp;conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book, like all books, is not above all criticism.  At times Sigal appears gleefully lurid, always using the words “penis,”  “vagina,” and “sodomy” where a less textually shocking term such as “genitalia” or “sex act” might suffice.  (Which actually is a bit ironic, given the Maya distrust of sexual excess&amp;#8230;)  One worries that such a hypersexualized and sexually explicit academic volume runs the risk of further “othering” the Maya in the minds of western readers.  Additionally, Sigal admits that the Maya language is “extremely complex and metaphorical, consciously veiled” making translation very challenging (xxi).  Still, it is clear that Sigal has made a serious effort to translate faithfully, even if translating sexually charged terms from Maya to English is somewhat problematic.  It is an exercise in cultural translation, translation from the sixteenth-century to the modern vernacular, and translation between systems that do not always&amp;nbsp;overlap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successfully, Sigal delves into a very complicated, seemingly contradictory, and ever-changing discourse of sexuality and makes historical sense out of it.  Sigal’s is a groundbreaking work that explores the Spanish Conquest from the perspective of gender.  Sigal concludes simply, “Sexual desire never was inert but rather was in a constant state of flux, and it always was used to create a discourse which related to power”&amp;nbsp;(249).&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Both &lt;em&gt;From Moon Goddess to Virgin&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sex and Conquest&lt;/em&gt; by Pete Sigal and Richard Trexler, respectively, are the product of fine research, scholarship, and (how to phrase it?) articulation. That is, both works examine issues, such as gender and sexuality, which are not easily classifiable, or at least not easily accessible to even the educated non-specialist. The careful elucidation required to effectively examine what John Locke termed “mixed modes” (nebulous terms that can hold different meanings to different users) is admirable enough; but this alone would not, in my view, give these two works the credit and audience they are due. Sigal and Trexler successfully incorporate gender and sexuality into the other spheres, such as politics, power, and religion, that can make gender and sexuality a central facet of historical investigation, rather than a mere adjunct to “real”&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete Sigal’s work focuses on the evolution of the Mayan religious worldview (a word, admittedly, I throw about with to much frequency; I simply cannot think of a better term). As Sigal phrases the “religious conquest” of the Maya, “[T]he ways in which Maya people made sense of their world were colonized and forever altered” (xiv). Crucial to understanding this shift is this simple dichotomy between the Maya and Catholic understandings of sexuality. For the Maya, “sexual desire was placed in a cultural framework centered around ritual,” whereas for the Spanish Catholics “sexual desire was placed in a framework related to sin” (xiv). Sigal seeks to under stand the relationship between desire and power in the Mayan indigenous religion(s) and in the resulting hybrid faiths that emerged form the syncretism. Sigal argues, convincingly, that sexual desires did not, and do not, exist without social constructs, and lays solid framework for discussing Maya sexual acts and ideas (7). Moreover, the “sacred sphere” was integral to the life of the Maya. Indeed, “Upon a child’s birth, sacred diviners told kin what the child’s life had in store for him or her” (19). This form of predestination enhances the ritual aspects of communal worship and, not incidentally, helps to place human sacrifice (among other things) in a more manageable&amp;nbsp;context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigal’s notable achievement, however, and the primary purpose of this book, is his analysis of how two central feminine figures in Maya and Catholic religious ideology combine to become something both recognizable and alien to both cultures. The Moon Goddess is an inherently sexual creature, a desire that crosses gender lines and affects both men and women. She is simultaneously a maternal being, and there is no contradiction in that: the mother Moon Goddess derives her power, her sacredness, from the renewal of the sexual act. Needless to say, this idea is anathema to the Spaniards, for whom the Virgin is not only the mother of God, but a figure whose reverence derives in no small part from the fact that she is “ever-virgin”—eternally chaste, forever demure and inviolate (101). The result is curious (and, I admit, one that I do not fully understand: the Virgin Mary becomes a figure that is a guide and intercessor; but the Moon Goddess did not simply disappear. “Like the desire for the saints,” Sigal writes with admirable understatement, “the concept of the Virgin Mary Moon Goddess perhaps pushed Catholicism to its limits”&amp;nbsp;(115).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Sigal’s task is difficult, Trexler’s is perhaps more so. &lt;em&gt;Sex and Conquest &lt;/em&gt;is an effort worthy of emulation, one that seeks to classify and describe attitudes, practices, and identities (including self-identities) as they relate to topics that may be difficult to articulate, let alone understand, and to do so with a dearth of both Spanish and indigenous&amp;nbsp;sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sexuality defines gender,” writes Trexler, “a discourse that is about power relations” (2). To that end, Trexler focuses on sexuality, particularly male homosexuality, as integral to both social and political power prior to and during the Conquest era. Key to his study is an examination of attitudes toward male homosexual behavior as vehicles for classifying the conquered as the proverbial “Other.” Trexler takes the long view of history, arguing, convincingly, that ancient examples of homosexual activity served the purpose of cementing power relationships, just as heterosexual unions throughout history have been used for the purposes of dealing with issues of&amp;nbsp;property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central to Trexler’s analysis in the figure of the berdache, a position that has no exact equivalent, to my knowledge, in modern Western history (certainly not in colonial American or United states history, although apparently in native North American cultures)—that is, a socially acceptable lifelong transvestite, “biological males that appeared to be women and who performed women’s tasks”&amp;nbsp;(67).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trexler, to his credit, does not shy from making broader observations about sexuality and its relation to culture and society. In particular, his discussion of child-raising and gendered roles in children, and his comments on the controversial topic of homosexuality’s innateness or construction is worth remembering, considering the social issues of modern America (85). In short, as I have mentioned in this blog and elsewhere, neither work is accessible through a single reading, and both have much insight to offer, not only about the period of the Conquest, but about universal human behavior and the varieties of&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Camilla Townsend. &lt;em&gt;Malintzin&amp;#8217;s Choices: An Indian Woman in the Conquest of Mexico&lt;/em&gt;. University of Mexico Press,&amp;nbsp;2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;http://libweb.hawaii.edu/libdept/charlotcoll/posada/images/posada/posbib45.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;291&#34; height=&#34;411&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: reading this book was a little tiresome after having read through the conquest of Mexico and its attendant events and personages several times already, enough to have the sequence of events, the important people, the sources, pretty well memorized. Given that Townsend&amp;#8217;s book unfolds in a rather novelistic manner, my previous familiarity probably detracted from the book&amp;#8217;s effect. I imagine that had I read it without much prior knowledge, it would have been more effective. As it was, there was little that I was not already aware of or sources I had not either already read or knew about. This is not necessarily a fault of the author- the extant traces of Malintzin&amp;#8217;s life are relatively few. She appears most prominently in Diaz&amp;#8217;s account and in the accounts of the Tlaxcalans, but even in those there is only so much that can be gathered. Townsend at least does a good job collating these various sources; at times she does engage in somewhat critical analysis of these scattered traces. At other times she seems to take the literary traces at face&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the introduction she promises to employ ethnographic material to further elucidate Malintzin&amp;#8217;s life; while some of this promised material appears, one suspects that much more could have been done with it. Certainly there is no great theoretical rigor, which is perhaps in part due to the projected audience of the book, though again one wonders how broad of an audience an academic title like this can reach. There is but one Amazon review, a not very good indicator for a book already four years old. It&amp;#8217;s a pity, really- Malintzin (or Dona Marina, or Malinche) has to be one, if not the most engaging and fascinating of the great cast of characters in the period of the conquest. Her life invites a novelistic or imaginative approach, and while Townsend- like many other academic writers who take this path- sometimes descends to rather maudlin scenes, overall, when examining Malintzin&amp;#8217;s place in the story, gives a decently imaginative and sympathetic account. At times Malintzin disappears, the reader wondering where exactly she has gone (have her choices run out? Are things finally fixed?). Yet she does continue to reappear, even in the final two chapters, where perhaps the strange and uncertain genealogy that Malintzin and her descendants bore- from one culture and kingdom to another, never quite fitting in anywhere yet often triumphing (or seeming to triumph at&amp;nbsp;least).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could bring up other problems- I suspect much more could be asked about the practices and ranges of action and meaning that Malintzin could draw upon in the course of her travels, as she rose to a degree of prominence few, men or women, indigenous or Spanish, in her world could claim. At any rate, Townsend has not exhausted what can be said about this genuinely (to my eyes at least) remarkable woman. Granted, much of what she did can be understood as falling within possible and accepted parameters within both indigenous and Spanish society. Nonetheless, it is hard not to feel the sort of admiration and even love that Diaz and apparently many others felt- admiration and love that continued to echo long after her death, that continues (mingled with hatred and rejection to be sure) to echo down to us, these long centuries&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Camilla Townsend’s &lt;em&gt;Malintzin’s Choices: An Indian Woman in the Conquest of Mexico &lt;/em&gt; is an interesting take on how to tell the story of the conquest.  Basing a historical work on a woman that is almost invisible in the written record can be a daunting task.  However, I found Townsend’s book easy to read and possessing a flow of information that didn’t bog you down.   However, I must admit I liked the first part of the book better.  There was more explanation of the life Malintzin would have experience by the time the conquest came around in the book it became just more of retelling of the story we have already read.  In the final sections of the book it was interesting to learn what happened to her children and grandchildren but it became a more central focus.  I guess I would have likes more information about Malintzin and her life but unless her secret diary is found hidden away I don’t see that happening.  Also I felt like the intention of the book was misleading Townsend presents her work as Malintzin’s “choices” but really I wonder what choice she really did have.  I mean she did do things which brought her a great position which she would never have had but how much of that was just luck of the draw.  She could have never known what was going to happen to her and life was a matter of survival, she just played her cards better.  But all in all I did enjoy the book as a whole.  Townsend managed to get away from the stuffy facts of the conquest and the hero or the Cortes worship the primary documents are drowning in.  And what comes out is a story that focusing on the invisible and most important people of the conquest, the translators.  Malintzin managed to form a position for herself that was beyond that of any other woman in her own culture earning the respect of the conquistadors.  However, once the people who truly knew her died away and nothing was left of her own voice her life fell prey to the tides of history making her a traitor to some.  Many justify her actions by saying she had no other choice or she was making the best of the situation.  But in my opinion that is not what happened.  You can’t be a traitor if there is no unified entity.  The Aztec people were far form a unified people they were separate and independent forming there own ethnic states, who made war with one another.  Malintzin held no allegiance to these people and by the time she got back to her own homeland she was so far engulfed in the conquest that it didn’t matter at that point.  If she had been translating for another Native American group she would not have been branded a traitor.  But since it was the European invaders she was betraying her own&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt; “La Malinche,” or “the fucked one” of Mexican myth is a contested figure—a figure that in 1982 still had the symbolic power to inspire student protests.  Townsend explains, “As [the protestors] understood the situation, they were standing up for their nation’s sovereignty and speaking up for the downtrodden Indians” (4).  La Malinche of the statue was a legend, a shadow, a tragedy, a&amp;nbsp;traitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Camilla Townsend’s Malintzin is a human being.  Townsend weaves a tapestry of possibilities that humanize the legend.   The real Malintzin, it seems, was above all a survivor, a woman who made pragmatic choices in awful situations.  Townsend’s book Malintzin’s Choices does not claim to be a biography of Malintzin.  Instead, it looks at her world as Malintzin might have seen it, and explores her choices in the context of the range of options that would have been available to her.  Malintzin’s Choices brings historians one step closer to understanding the Spanish Conquest, and especially to understanding the range of choices that would have been available to indigenous women in that historical situation.  Throughout the book, Townsend looks at the grim realities of the Spanish Conquest through the lens of gender.  She deals with this violent time sensitively, and does not label perpetrators and victims, does not fixate on the gruesome.  Townsend strives for balance, such as on page 127 when she describes indigenous human sacrifice and Spanish torture practices side by side, matter-of-factly, without sensational language or any resort to voyeuristic excess.  It is this even-handedness which makes the book stand&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likely given to attacking Indians as a peace offering (22), and then traded to strangers from across the sea, it at first appears that the slave girl Malintzin did not have a lot of options.  She was summarily baptized and probably expected to cook food and sexually service a Spanish conquistador.  But she had grown up in a Mesoamerican palace, and she possessed the skill of using courtly language, and she chose to make the most of it.  Townsend stresses that the choice to become an interpreter for Hernán Cortés was just that—a choice.  When she heard Jerónimo de Aguilar speaking a dialect of Maya to the messengers of Moctezuma, “Malintzin could have remained silent.  No one expected her to step forward and serve as a conduit.  But by the end of that hour, she had made her value felt” (41).  That decision would change her path forever.  She became an important person, a valued interpreter, and acquired the title “doña” just like a Spanish noblewoman.  She bore a child with Cortes, and seems to have maneuvered herself into an advantageous marriage afterward, securing her children a place in the New World that was being created in the sixteenth century.  But Malintzin remains a liminal figure, betwixt and between several&amp;nbsp;worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her son, Don Martín, inherits all this from her.  As a six-year-old child, Martín is taken by his father Hernán Cortés to Spain, where the boy grows up at the Spanish court, in the retinue of Prince Philip.  He is legitimized by a papal bull from the pope, and stands to inherit his father’s estate until Cortés remarries and has a second Martín, who, in many ways (and certainly legally via the inheritance) “would almost erase the existence of his older brother” (197).  But like his mother, Don Martín survived, became a knight of Spain, likely visited the Tudor court of Princess Mary of England, and returned to Mexico in his late thirties only to be tortured under suspicion of a plot to overthrow the Audiencia (which he denied, even when his captors put him on the rack, and when that did not work, waterboarded him six times).  This complicated man returned to Europe and was killed fighting Muslims  for Spain. He died in another conquest, in another&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the book, Townsend paints a very complicated portrait of Malintzin and the captive indigenous women whom she represents—in fact, this is a complicated portrait of the indigenous world during conquest.  There are no clear lines between conqueror and conquered, just like Malinche is neither traitor, nor whore, nor hero.  She is just a woman who did the best she could.  And ironically, even had the Spaniards never come, she still would have lived her life as a captive, in a foreign land—it just would have had different&amp;nbsp;contours.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed Malintzin’s Choices. But it also had its problems. It was perhaps the quickest read that I have ever worked through.  Townsend’s style is, I think, the reason for my enjoyment.  For a historical work it is unusual.  She combines academic techniques from ethnography, anthropology, and history and produces a book that reads somewhat like a novel.  I admit, there were times in this book when I was a little shocked at the claims she makes&amp;#8230;the weather at a given time is probably unrecoverable and her “setting the stage” so to speak is probably not the best way to win friends and influence in academia.  But I’m not sure if I would like anyone who would disparage her book for simply this.  Refreshing breezes need to occasionally blow…&lt;br /&gt;
I do have some mixed feelings about this book.  My initial reaction was &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WOW&lt;/span&gt;, what s smooth read.  I remember my initial reaction to someone who attempted a similar approach but bizarrely gave it up and definitely fell short (Ramon Gutierrez) and I was angry that a book could claim so much from the letters of a friar.  I am worried that I am running away with a “fun” read and being un-critical.  Now comparing both books in my mind I think the sources make all the difference.  Townsend actually uses work that looks at the lives of the Nahua and Maya before the arrival of the “men from the boats.”  I like that this book makes the conquest more of a process, but does it through a lack of effort.  What I mean by this is that Townsend shows us how the Conquest was a process, intricately connecting events, people, and intellectual processes, before and after the grand narrative poured down by men like Cortes and Diaz.&lt;br /&gt;
But there are problems too.  This book is the inverse of the conquest as seen through Cortes and Diaz, but I don’t think Townsend is able to break away from their paradigm.  Where are the choices? We get a nice foundation for the opening up of a new reading of the conquest, but then it is simply trying to find Malintzin in the sources.  Not that there is anything wrong with this approach, it just doesn’t seem to effectively reveal her “choices”. I feel like I get glimpses of Malintzin, but she has been “anthropologized” (kind of like a transformer) into something more evocative of a desire for liberation than one who lived her life in prospect and made&amp;nbsp;decisions.   &lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s a shame, really, that I have to be critical of &lt;em&gt;Malintzin&amp;#8217;s Choices&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Malintzin&amp;#8217;s Choices&lt;/em&gt;, Camilla Townsend has crafted an eminently readable and highly gripping tale of the native woman at the heart of the Spanish conquest of Mexico.  The book reads like a novel, and while it passed the time enjoyably, it seemed to be full of emotional and impressionistic assertions that cannot be demonstrated or supported by the evidence.  Let me offer two&amp;nbsp;examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On page 130, Townsend describes the political situation in Tetzcoco.  She writes, &amp;#8220;when the Spanish came, Ixtlilxochitl saw a marvelous political opportunity and went to ally himself with them, hoping to gain control over the entire kingdom.  After the Spanish arrested and then killed Cacama, Coanacochtli &amp;#8212; Ixtlilxochitl&amp;#8217;s full brother &amp;#8212; was able to replace him as king of the southern part of the altepetl, the part still known as Tetzcoco.  He did not share his brother&amp;#8217;s desire to ingratiate himself with the powerful strangers; he simply hated them.&amp;#8221;  This is an evocative passage that continues for another half-dozen sentences.  Yet, in this account, Townsend makes a number of questionable assertions without a single citation or mention of the source material.  Claims about desire, hatred, and hope create an entertaining story, but it is difficult to see how Townsend can know about the emotional states of these historical actors.  Still, such writing techniques need not necessarily be problematic, but in this episode, Townsend explains the actions of these figures by invoking their emotional states; these emotions, then, are acting as historical agents.  Such claims are both problematic and&amp;nbsp;troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On pages 44 and 45, Townsend describes an episode of the Spaniards&amp;#8217; misconceptions about indigenous wealth, taken from the account of Bernal Diaz.  Describing Malintzin&amp;#8217;s response to the Spaniards&amp;#8217; misunderstanding, Townsend writes, &amp;#8220;whether or not she actually made a joke of it that bright June day we will never know, but certainly she and the other women must have laughed to themselves more than once to see these great strong men with their remarkable machines turn out to be more gullible than they had ever known any of their own warriors to be.&amp;#8221;  Words such as &amp;#8220;certainly&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;must&amp;#8221; seem overly bold and out of place in a sentence that is an interpretation based on inference rather than on textual evidence.  I am, however, willing to concede that Townsend is probably correct in making this inference from Diaz&amp;#8217;s account, but at the same time Townsend goes too far with it in making the response to Spanish ignorance and gullibility a matter of gender.  It does not seem evident to me that Malintzin&amp;#8217;s laughter originates from expectations about gender, but rather from an obvious cultural divide, from social and cultural expectations that may have something to do with gender, but are not ultimately based on gender.  I might be wrong, and Townsend may be correct.  But Townsend fails to offer any evidence or even supporting analysis for her reading of the text.  Instead, she simply wraps her assumptions in the language of facts and continues with her&amp;nbsp;narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found such incidents of scholarly sloppiness on nearly every page of the text, and ultimately I found it very disappointing.  I am glad that someone has written an evocative account of the Conquest from a perspective that offers an alternative to the cultural, social, and gender assumptions that come from a mere rewriting of the Spanish narrative sources.  But I do think that such an account could have been more scholarly.  As a case in point, I would offer Natalie Zemon Davis&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Return of Martin Guerre&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Although Camilla Townsend&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Malintzin&amp;#8217;s Choices &lt;/em&gt;attempts to understand the historical figure of Dona Malina, it also studies the larger patterns of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. On one level it seeks to understand a life which the author suggests might have been ordinary if not for extreme coincidences. On a deeper level it traces how her meaning has changed throughout history. On a still deeper level, it attempts to state what is known about the Nahua in the age of the conquest. The study is sympathetic to her cause, humanizing her attempt to navigate between options not always desirable and showing the complexity of the larger clash of cultures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As admitted by the author, little evidence is available about her life. At best, there is only a “murky window” into her life. In absence of abundant primary documents, she considers the context and attempts to place Malinche within it. She asks two questions. First, how did she matter in her own time? Secondly, what did events mean to her? In the end, Townsend presents her as typical, suggesting if she had not played her role, someone else would have. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Structurally, the book is largely arranged chronologically. The first chapter describes the indigenous tribes before the conquest, presenting them as a contentious collection of self-serving units on many levels. The second chapter covers the initial contact through native eyes, in which Townsend decidedly argues against the idea of the Spanish appearing as gods to the indigenous tribes. From there the book describes the complicated role of translators, suggesting that Malinche&amp;#8217;s initial choice was made for self-serving reasons. Chapters four through seven describe the conquest and Malinche is largely absent. Indeed, Townsend seems more interested in portraying the indigenous tribes as skillfully playing both sides for their own gain during and after the conquest. The last two chapters address the fate of her daughter and son. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work does not buy into many myths of the conquest. It does, however, present the Spanish as superior, not because they were genetically dominant but because they had been agriculturally settled for longer and able to develop technology such as steel swords. While such an idea could present an unbalanced view of the conquest, Townsend is careful to balance it with the idea that much of the success of the conquest stemmed from the Spanish use of native allies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work is a decent synthesis of much of what is already known about the conquest, albeit written in more colorful prose than typical scholarly studies. Snippets of what is already known are woven into an attempt to solve the mystery of Malinche, an attempt which is not entirely successful. Not much is known about her and most of Townsend&amp;#8217;s contribution to history is in explaining what she was not, dispelling the inaccuracies of previous studies. Unfortunately these efforts are largely buried in the footnotes for the sake of a smooth narrative. What does end up in the main text can border on speculation. Townsend is careful to phrase her picture of Malinche as a suggestion where applicable. Still, much of her book, while interesting and intellectually stimulating, does not give the reader a more concrete image of the historical figure. In the end, her claim that a complete picture cannot be known is the most valuable insight and the work is useful for what it strikes down rather than what it adds to the discussion.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-6717563392170612757?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <id>/history561/posts/malintzine28099s-many-contexts.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I was suspicious of Camilla Townsend&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Malintzin&amp;#8217;s Choices&lt;/em&gt; before I had even read the back cover. After all, I reasoned, how does one attempt a biography of a person who left no written records, and can only be accessed through dubious (in my view) secondary sources, in which category I inlude Cortes and Bernal Diaz. I therefore found Professor Townsend&amp;#8217;s frank discussion of the problems inherent in such an approach refreshing and welcome. No &lt;em&gt;traditional&lt;/em&gt; biography of Dona Marina is feasible, as Townsend knows very well. But by examining the several Spanish sources together, she argues that it is feasible to reconstruct aspects of her world (and perhaps her worldview) for our examination, even if we cannot determine precisely how she responded to the situation in which found herself both crucial and&amp;nbsp;marginalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book, while focusing on Malintze, is equally about the indigenous experience of the Conquest, as Townsend claims, and especially about the female experience of the turbulent era. Although I knew full well that the Spaniards baptized the indigenous women before taking sexual advantage of them, in Townsend&amp;#8217;s account these actions are more fully explained. To our modern sensibilities, this seems contradictory, not to mention criminally hypocritical. Townsend is particularly effective, however, in reminding  us that, whatever our sense of distaste, the baptisms were fully in keeping with the Spanish modus operandi, and must be understood in that context (36). The same applies for the now-well-understood establishment of the cabildo. The author is adept at explaining the situation clearly, and concisely: &amp;#8220;He [Cortes] arranged to have the expedition&amp;#8217;s men &lt;em&gt;demand&lt;/em&gt; that they attemt to conquer&amp;nbsp;Moctezuma&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;(44).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more important for understand this meeting of two worlds, in my view, is Townsend&amp;#8217;s presentation of the much larger, even macro, context. Her discussion of agriculture immediately comes to mind: understanding that ancient corn was less nutritive than ancient wheat and peas is essential to understanding  the evolution of societies, including their technological evolution. Similarly, the surviving pictorial representations of Malintze are telling, according to Townsend; there is a reason she is sometimes portrayed as larger than the surrounding figures: &amp;#8220;She expertly supervises the collection of tribute on the Spaniards&amp;#8217; behalf&amp;#8221; (75). (I confess, I sometimes fall into the trap of assuming premodern artists did not understand&amp;nbsp;depth.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of this book, of course, moves beyond Malintze, as mentioned above. She argues, pragmatically, that in order to understand Moctezuma&amp;#8217;s thoughts and motives, for example, &amp;#8220;we essentially have only his previous and future actions to go on&amp;#8221; (89) The Mexica ruler was not caught off-guard, as many sources and modern histories attest. In fact, according to Townsend, he had been warily keeping an eye on the sea since 1517. Even if any analysis of Moctezuma is conjecture, the author claims, convincingly, that the effort helps to &amp;#8220;undermine any easy acceptance of the utterances as fact&amp;#8221; (89). &lt;em&gt;Malintzin&amp;#8217;s Choices &lt;/em&gt;is both a fine work of ethnohistory as well as a testament to the benefits and possibilities of ethnohistory to those of us who work with more familiar sources and with historical periods much closer to our own. Townsend&amp;#8217;s book in some ways reminds me of Donald Kagan&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Peloponnesian War&lt;/em&gt;. Kagan has only Thucydides&amp;#8217; work to rely on, along with a very few other sources, but from that he is able to, with some ambiguity, describe the history and worldviews of other Greek city-states and the Persian Empire. (This is not the most apt analogy, but I can currently not think of a better&amp;nbsp;one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Townsend must be commended in spending time on Malintzin&amp;#8217;s job. Every chronicle and modern history mentions that she served as a translator (among other things), but few give credit to the exhausting and unenviable position she found herself in (or, for all we know, wrangled herself into). The sheer act of translating, according to Townsend, is mentally very taxing, but that was not the end of her responsibility. She was the messenger who actually communicated the demands, and could do little to alleviate what must have been terribly awkward situations. &amp;#8220;Despite her many skills,&amp;#8221; Townsend writes, &amp;#8220;there was absolutely nothing Malintzin could do to change the situation&amp;#8221; (120). This comment, and this book, testify to the young woman&amp;#8217;s grit and resourcefulness. The author, appropriately, offers no definitive answer as to whether Malintzin was a sexy opportunist or one who served as the proverbial &amp;#8220;bitch,&amp;#8221; as she puts it. There is no doubt she was in a hellish environment, and there is little doubt, it seems, that she used what tools she had at her disposal to carve a living in an uncertain world. That, it seems to me, is&amp;nbsp;laudworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;James Krippner-Martinez. &lt;em&gt;Rereading the Conquest: Power, Politics, and the History of Early Colonial Michoacan, Mexico, 1521-1565.&lt;/em&gt; University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,&amp;nbsp;2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The date in Krippner-Martinez&amp;#8217;s title rather belies the actual content of the book. His study is as much about post-conquest, post-sixteenth century constructions and memories of the conquest and the early period of Spanish control of Michoacan, as it is about the period itself. While the book is composed of what Krippner calls &amp;#8216;autonomous essays,&amp;#8217; they all have the unifying theme of a close reading and questioning of various constructed records of the past- some of them created long after the described events. Many of the archives and narratives Krippner examines operate out of a colonial matrix, something he is intent to demonstrate; because of the location of these narratives, even when they include indigenous or otherwise dissenting voices, Krippner argues, they are only speaking through the medium of the&amp;nbsp;conqueror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is not a new argument, obviously, and Krippner is not the first to subject the materials he covers to such a reading, the usefulness of the studies he includes lies in their questioning of even those aspects of the Spanish conquest and post-conquest that would at first glance seem to contradict the general thread of violence and exploitation. Krippner argues that even the Franciscans and such seemingly revolutionary clerics as Vasco de Quiroga are also part of the process of Spanish conquest and consolidation of power. While they may modify and even critique elements of the process, they are integral to it, and do not question the basic propriety of Spanish control of the &amp;#8216;New World.&amp;#8217; Likewise, Krippner argues, depictions of &amp;#8216;aberrant&amp;#8217; conquistadors, like Nuno de Guzman, serves to reinforce the basic rightness of the conquest. de Guzman and those like him become explanations of evil and excessive violence; their depraved behavior, distinct from the wider process of conquest, is aberrant and therefore not to be identified with the larger project. Against this Krippner argues that even men like de Guzman were a part of the process, and their violence in fact necessary for it to succeed. Far from being aberrant, they were a integral part- both in what they actually did, and the narrative role they later served in justifying and defending the conquest&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krippner however is as much concerned with how these events were looked at in later years- from the 18th chronicle of Pablo Beaumont to contemporary understandings and uses of the figure of Vasco de Quiroga. The figures and events of the conquest and its immediate aftermath continue to be employed for a wide variety of actors, from conservative Catholics to their anticlerical opponents in the revolutionary and post-revolutionary periods. These constructions, Krippner contends, can tell little about the past itself, but reveal much about the ways the past can be employed. A figure like de Quiroga, in particular, lends himself to discovery and reconstruction, from the understanding of his ideological standing to the literal physical location of his bones. Much like de Quiroga&amp;#8217;s bones- which underwent a spectrum from neglect to pseudo-scientific investigation to honored veneration- the events of the conquest and its later memory has undergone many transformations, and continues to be an object of use, of contestation, and deeply-held memory and&amp;nbsp;emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Everybody likes a good execution story…especially people who are going to write dissertations about them.  I especially like his interpretation of violence as a receivable text.  I study executions in terms of the text of the event.  Though it is often gruesome, the process of imposing violence is often very informative.  His accounts of the trials, tortures, and executions do a good job of showing exactly how violence was envisioned and used as a tool in the “vision of the victors”.   Though I think he might have more usefully entitled this chapter: visions of the victors, since conceptually, he seems to aim at the multiplicity of perspectives over time.&lt;br /&gt;
His account of violence even helped me by illustrating the ways in which violence was linked to gender.  Honor is the most important concept here.  Previously I had looked at scenes of execution as purely political scenes, basically the first chapter of Foucault’s Discipline and Punish.  This adds an additional element. As a text one might use different inks to really a similar message: while the ultimate message might be political, the pictures on the lienzo of a violent scene might have different colored inks and pictures in addition to words.&lt;br /&gt;
The one quibble that I have with this book is the last chapter.  Admittedly, Krippner-Martinez presented his book as a series of essays intimately tied to historiography, but while the last chapter was interesting in a very particular way and as an illustration of the ever-popular “shifting trends” in scholarship, I don’t know if it added greatly to my understanding of the conquest.  Certainly this chapter has a specific purpose, which, it seemed to me, was to outline historiographical trends through the changes in fortune of the memory of Tato Vasco.  My reaction here I think might also be because, until now we have only read sources concerning earlier eras and Krippner-Martinez takes his reader to the present with this&amp;nbsp;chapter. &lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rereading the Conquest: Power, Politics, and the History of Early Colonial Michoacán, Mexico 1521-1565&lt;/em&gt;, by James Krippner-Martinez, is a poststructural, postmodern investigation into the textuality of history.  Much of the book is what James Lockhart would call “stunning textual pyrotechnics,” but that probably would not bother Krippner-Martinez, because he pays little heed to the Lockhart School of Latin American&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into two parts, the second of which is much more successful than the first.  Krippner-Martinez is at his best explaining the ways that late colonial conservative creole identity manifests itself in historical texts.  In Part &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;, Chapter 4 deals with the &lt;em&gt;Crónica de Michoacán&lt;/em&gt;, written in 1788 by Franciscan intellectual Pablo de Beaumont.  Here, Krippner-Martinez “seek[s] to evaluate how a distinct historical context and various subjective factors influenced a specific text, one that rewrote the narrative of the conquest of Michoacán” (115).  Krippner-Martinez convincingly argues that Beaumont writes in a space between Baroque and Enlightenment intellectual contexts, and because of this, the &lt;em&gt;Crónica&lt;/em&gt; displays an interesting and complicated relationship between the rational and supernatural.  The work is a sort of union of opposites, as “Beaumont’s Enlightenment skepticism clashes with his profoundly held conviction that the Spanish Conquest of the Americas had been divinely ordained” (127).  Beaumont correctly understood that the Spanish Conquest was not an event, “but rather represented a process constantly challenged and continually recreated over time”&amp;nbsp;(132).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 5, Krippner-Martinez seeks to understand and historicize the construction of the “Tata Vasco,” or “Father Vasco” myth surrounding Vasco de Quiroga, and the ways that people have appropriated that myth in the modern era.  The author writes, “here I contend that the traditional image of Vasco de Quiroga as a saintly father figure, who understood and was beloved by his Indian charges, is an after-the-fact reconstruction, rooted more in colonial discourse, creole perceptions, and the formation of modern Mexican nationalism than the sixteenth-century past” (152).  Here, he makes his case&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part I is somewhat less convincing, although it has its strong points as well.  It is good that the author resists the “great man” myth surrounding leading figures of the Spanish conquest.  For example, he says, “although Nuño de Guzmán was brutal, it would be wrong to view him as exceptional” (36).  At times, Krippner-Martinez’s analysis dovetails nicely with the Lockhart school.  He writes, “there is absolutely no evidence … that the ‘native king’ defined his obligations to Spanish colonialism according to the norms of the colonizers” (17).  And his argument that the Spanish “sought to justify colonial rule by demonstrating what Spaniards believed to be the ‘perverse otherness’ of indigenous peoples, conceived of in sexual and other terms” is excellent, if not entirely new&amp;nbsp;(118).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these insights, Krippner-Martinez’s allegiance to postmodern theory pushes him into discussions of power and resistance that do not always fit the subject.  Spanish power was not so consolidated in 1530 as to be Foucaultian.  Resistance, too is a slippery concept.  The word is so laden with meaning—it conjures up an image of the archetypal downtrodden hero rising up in ethnic solidarity to resist the evil hegemonic power destroying his way of life.  But the gritty, business-as-usual, daily reality of conquest and colonization was less thrilling and more complicated.  James Lockhart shows us in &lt;em&gt;Of Things of the Indies&lt;/em&gt; that the convergence of Spanish and Mesoamerican cultures allowed for a great deal of continuity between the pre and post-contact periods that precluded a great deal of resistance, at least among sedentary indigenous&amp;nbsp;peoples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John A Kicza, a student of James Lockhart, reviewed &lt;em&gt;Rereading the Conquest&lt;/em&gt;  in his review article &lt;em&gt;New Interpretations of Colonial Mexico from the Conquest to Independence&lt;/em&gt;, appearing in Volume 40, Number 3 (2005) of the Latin American Research Review.  Kicza writes, “Regarding most of the extant secondary literature on these documents as limited if not wrong headed, Krippner-Martinez makes little use of&amp;nbsp;it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Krippner-Martinez has ignored the insights of the Lockhart School, Chapter Three is terribly problematic.  He seems to admire many sixteenth century missionaries in Latin America, and somewhat sanitizes them. Krippner-Martinez glosses clerical hypocrisy, writing “at least in some cases … the sixteenth century clergy was not always beyond [sexual] temptation” (100). Some cases?  Not beyond temptation?!   This is a gross&amp;nbsp;understatement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with a 1589 Maya petition to have a local priest removed.  The document appears in &lt;em&gt;Mesoamerican Voices: Native-Language Writings from Colonial Mexico, Oaxaca, Yucatán, and Guatemala&lt;/em&gt;, edited by Matthew Restall, Lisa Sousa, and Kevin Terraciano (all students of James Lockhart).  Here, the indigenous community complained of their holy missionary, “Until they recompense him with the sin of fornication, he does not give the women confession” (Restall et all p. 168).  Another example from Restall et al is the 1774 petition against four friars in the Mani Region: “But look at their excessive fornication, putting their hands on these prostitutes’ vaginas, even saying mass like this.  God willing, when the English come they may not be fornicators equal to these priests, who stop short only at carnal acts with men’s asses.  God willing that smallpox be rubbed into their penis heads.  Amen.” (Restall et al p.&amp;nbsp;169).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krippner-Martinez discusses the meanings of the colonial discourses of gender.  He explores Spanish reasons for using sexuality to “other” indigenous people, explaining that this process legitimizes Spanish dominance in the colonizers’ eyes.  But this is not enough.  He fails to grapple with clerical wickedness, the persistence of indigenous religious forms, and the ways that Catholicism adapted to Indian&amp;nbsp;beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krippner-Martinez has high aspirations for the book and uses fresh methods.  But I found &lt;em&gt;Rereading the Conquest&lt;/em&gt; disappointing.   At the end of the day, despite his postmodern textual analyses and insights into the production of myths and texts, the author reproduces both the black and white legends.   Once again, the “bad” conquistador is contrasted with the “good”&amp;nbsp;missionary. &lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rereading the Conquest&lt;/em&gt;, by James Krippner-Martinez, examines the Spanish conquest of Mexico by focusing on the constantly challenged process of subduing Michoacan. At issue is how political and economic concerns influenced the historical narrative, making the study one of the intersection of religion, politics, and the writing of history. In the process, the author takes a closer look at selective recording in historical documents and the subsequent partial reconstruction by historians, revealing the filters through which history is seen, and reaching “tentative understandings” of his subjects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first section of the book, based on primary documents, features three essays in chronological order, examining representations of the events and actors of first generation contact. Two themes addressed through the work are the brutality of the military campaign and the distinctive role of the Catholic Church. The first essay claims the execution of the Cazonci demonstrated Spanish consolidation over the region. The act was a contested moment and the document was created, using selected evidence, to justify the actor, Nuno de Guzman. The act was done out of frustration for failing to achieve a swift conquest, and the torture was a demonstration of humiliation and control. To add to the story, the victim might have seen himself as more of a partner than subject in the arrangement with the Spanish. Attacked are the myths of the passive native and the brutal conquistador.  The second essay examines encounters between missionaries and indigenous peoples, the results of a collaboration between the cultures that suggests an accepted role. It also reveals the political and social struggles between the church and state and challenges the humiliation of the conquest. The third essay examines the case of Vasco de Quiroga, finding him to be humane for his time if not paternalistic and ethnocentric. The study, which the author claims must be understood in the context of the conquest, also shows that the continuing conflict gave the indigenous peoples room to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second section examines the same history through the passage of time. The first essay reexamines the missionary contact between the Spanish and indigenous peoples. That there was a continual need for evangelism, the author argues, suggests there was a continued rejection of Catholicism. The myth of divine ordination is thus challenged, as the spiritual conquest was open ended. The essay also argues that atrocities were an aberration. The documents examined show history through the struggles of the era in which they were written. The last chapter reexamines Vasco de Quiroga, claiming that multiple images of him emerged and that and that his heroism is a modern construct, an after the fact creation. In the conclusion, the author argues that the church was complicit in the conquest and that this fact must be accepted to truly understand the history of the era, though the work does not methodically lead to this conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at primary historical documents requires understanding the multiple filters through which it disseminated, something of which the author aptly demonstrates. Even when the documents are decidedly written on behalf of one faction, as in the ones examined, reading between the lines shows much about the other side of the story, as the documents of &lt;em&gt;Rereading the Conquest &lt;/em&gt;show much about the indigenous population in the absence of their own primary documents, though the author admits he cannot fully recover history. Through the subtleties of the text, the documents show us much about the conquest, chiefly that it was a process and not an event as the Spanish never culturally subdued the indigenous population. Indeed, the work focuses on culture and largely omits the military conquest, which serves to challenge more myths than typical studies. Most importantly, it avoids casting the conquest in terms of either the black legend or the white legend. By focusing on multiple layers of Spanish actors (the church versus the state, for example), the Spanish might be self-serving even if they evade further concrete classification. By examining the multiple hierarchies of indigenous peoples, albeit in between the lines, the native population might be seen as nominally controlled but otherwise far from subdued. Indeed, the very use of the word conquest must be challenged.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-8337111566172770521?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <title type="html">A Refreshing Reread</title>
            <author><name>Chad Black</name></author>
            <link href="/history561/posts/a-refreshing-reread.html"/>

            <id>/history561/posts/a-refreshing-reread.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;James Krippner-Martinez&amp;#8217;s fine book excels, to my mind, on three accounts. First, as all good works of history should, &lt;em&gt;Rereading the Conquest &lt;/em&gt;both adds to our understanding of the Conquest as well as questions some of the more deeply held assumptions about the personages of the era. Second, the author seamlessly interweaves the historiography of the Conquest (specifically, in this case, the historiography about the conquest of Michoacan) into his narrative and analysis, which serves the non-specialist reader exceptionally well. Third, Krippner-Martinez is concerned with broader questions regarding the study of history that every student should (perhaps must) incorporate into one&amp;#8217;s mental methodology if one wishes to make significant contributions to his or her&amp;nbsp;field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will begin by commenting on this last point. It is significant that Krippner-Martinez is working with few or no new materials here, as his title implies. With the exception of his last chapter and conclusion, which discuss more recent historiography, the text examines materials that have been known to scholars, and analyzed by them, for centuries. As concerns the Conquest and colonial eras in Michoacan, Mexico, of course, this makes sense, as there is a finite number of primary sources available. But I believe Krippner-Martinez is, at least implicitly, endeavoring to make a larger point: just because materials have been examined by multiple generations of scholars does not mean their value has been exhausted, or that all that remains is for younger historians to do minor mopping up work. Rather, it is incumbent upon students and scholars to re-evaluate their field of study and the materials therein as a whole, to ask questions that are more accurate and salient, which Professor Krippner-Martinez does very&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wit: The first chapter, &amp;#8220;The Vision of the Victors,&amp;#8221; examines the &lt;em&gt;Proceso&lt;/em&gt;, the account of the trial of the Cazonci by the authority of Nuno de Guzman, traditionally one of the more disreputable of the conquistadors. By a careful reading, observing both what the record contains and what it omits, Krippner-Martinez arrives at two conclusions: that the Indians were not passive to the efforts of the Spaniards, lacking agency; and the conquistador (in this case Guzman) was not &amp;#8220;abberrant and even pathological&amp;#8221; but pragmatic and efficient, acting within the paradigms of his time and place (10). The author gives due credit to the tenuous nature of the document by explaining the multiple hands through which it passed (as many as four of rive in the case of the Native American testimonies), but argues, for the most part convincingly, that &amp;#8220;This is not to say that the testimonies contained in this document are fraudulent or valueless&amp;#8221; (15). Throughout this chapter, and the work as a whole, Krippner-Martinez emphasizes context. &amp;#8220;We cannot understand the execution [of the Cazonci],&amp;#8221; he writes, &amp;#8220;unless we take into account the frustrations of the initial wave of Spanish settlers and their self-defined need to establish control over the region&amp;#8221; (21). His careful, competent analysis of the material is appealing&amp;#8211;one wishes that every author would write with such directness and&amp;nbsp;clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is also, it is fair to claim, writing with an agenda beyond a mere re-examination of the Conquest, and that, too, is refreshing. His descriptions of torture (including, on page 33, so-called &amp;#8220;water torture&amp;#8221;) are explicit, and are presented with an analysis of the significance of torture (personal dominance, not humiliation per se). Similarly, his descriptions of Beaumont&amp;#8217;s later efforts to understand and justify what many (then and since) have considered the excesses of the Conquest raise larger questions about morality and the means to ends. A scholar who wishes to tackle serious historical events, Krippner-Martinez seems to be saying, must also tackle serious, and at times discomfiting, issues of morality&amp;#8211;while striving to keep one&amp;#8217;s own subjectivity under control. Indeed, at the book&amp;#8217;s end, he explicitly denounced the ongoing efforts of the Catholic Church to present the &amp;#8220;spiritual conquest&amp;#8221; of the Americas as the result of divine will, stating, simply, &amp;#8220;It is time for a change&amp;#8221; (183). Even given the relative secularism of most of the academics I know, this strikes me as a gutsy&amp;nbsp;statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is not without its flaws, however. For all his merits, Krippner-Martinez&amp;#8217;s analysis  more than once descends into the realm of what one of my professors called &amp;#8220;inside baseball.&amp;#8221; That is, he knows the material so well that he is not always the most effective communicator. On page 34, for example, he briefly mentions the wel-known rivalry between Guzman and Cortes, asserting that &amp;#8220;it is plausible to suggest that the Cazonci also may have been victimized by the factional politics of the conquerors themselves.&amp;#8221; While he does later mention the rivalry, briefly, this statement is far too significant to lack further discussion, which the author does not provide. Another example is his examination of Beaumont&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Cronica &lt;/em&gt;in Chapter 4, in which he does not clearly introduce the &lt;em&gt;Aparato&lt;/em&gt; to the non-specialist; it simply appears in the middle of the paragraph, leading this reader, for one, to go back and wonder if I had missed something  (I had not) (114-5).  At times we may question whether his efforts at reading against the grain are in fact not examples of his reading into the text assumptions about motives that can not be properly&amp;nbsp;ascertained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are quibbles, however. While the above concerns are legitimate, they do not significantly detract from the value and accomplishment of the book. &lt;em&gt;Rereading the Conquest&lt;/em&gt; is the work of a scholar at the top of his game. The work adds to the hisotiographical discussion by questioning old asumptions and articulating new questions&amp;#8211;which themselves, the author understands, will be amended by future historians down the line. As he concludes, the point of his research (and, by extension, all historical investigation) &amp;#8220;is not to deny the reality of the sixteenth century, but rather to note the historiographical distance that must be overcome to catch even a fleeting glimpse of the actual past&amp;#8221; (191). For this student, that is certainly a mission statement worth keeping in&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Krippner-Martinez’s work &lt;em&gt;Rereading the Conquest &lt;/em&gt;is a different take on the story of the Spanish Conquest.  Up till now we have predominantly been reading primary sources from the people who have participated.  And other than notes to accompany the books little explanation has been put forth.  Krippner-Martinez takes a different root by placing events and people into their proper historical context.  While reading this book the idea of myth building kept coming to mind especially when it comes to our own historical figures.  As a kid you are always taught what wise and great men the founding fathers of our country were and later you learn that they made many mistakes and were very flawed men.   The problem as Krippner-Martinez points out in his book is that we are not examining things in the right context and it is his intention to use this book to do so.  His examination of Vasco de Quirago exemplified this intention.  Like our founding father myths similar ones have been created surrounding Vasco de Quirago.  However, after placing him in the historical context in which he was acting a different story comes to light.  I always find it very interesting to go back and examine how things got started, how myths were born, and how lies can actually become truth given enough&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Rereading the Conquest is a thoughtful and careful interrogation of the principal textual evidence for early colonial Michoacán.  Krippner-Martinez offers a postmodern critique of the surviving texts, seeing them not as impartial evidence, but as texts carefully constructed for the purposes of their authors.  The Proceso contra Tzintzincha Tangaxoan, for example, is not merely a record of the trial and execution of the Michoacán Cazonci, but is also an artifact from the trial itself.  Examining the construction of texts such as the Proceso provides valuable insight into the societies that created them.  Furthermore, Krippner-Martinez argues that the construction of texts is the result of relationships of power, that it is not only modern scholars who use these texts as a means of ordering and understanding a society, but also the authors, who themselves engaged in such ordering.  The text is not the past, but a representation of it.  In Rereading the Conquest, the memory of the past is as much an object of study as the past itself.  The memory of the past is an important tool in the creation of identities and the construction of societies, and Krippner-Martinez demonstrates that the memory of the conquest of Michoacán played an important part in the ordering of later Michoacán societies, and indeed, still does in the present.  In his interrogation of these texts, Krippner-Martinez brings to the fore the role of violence in the establishment of Spanish authority in Michoacán.  Violence manifested in various ways, and in turn the participants interpreted violence through an array of social, cultural, and political lenses.  Rereading the Conquest does an excellent job of illuminating the complex attitudes about violence in the sixteenth-century Spanish empire, demonstrating that violence was not merely an accepted part of the imperial process, but a topic of discussion among both the conquerors and the&amp;nbsp;conquered.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Thoughts on: &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=oCyHKZNduVsC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=Restall+Guatemala&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=To9JHeQcRz&amp;amp;sig=JZXJS0VdRoHRWLSLeuPc79TJfk8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=pLWMS4DfBsyUtgfp96TwCA&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=2&amp;amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;Mesoamerican Voices: Native Language Writings from Colonial Mexico, Yucatan, and Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;, and on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Invading-Guatemala-Spanish-Accounts-Conquest/dp/0271027584&#34;&gt;Invading Guatemala: Spanish, Nahua, and Maya Accounts of the Conquest&amp;nbsp;Wars &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Did you know: the appearance of things shifts with the ground you stand on. As we move from the single narrative of a Cortes or Diaz, from the one to the many of other Spanish accounts and the diverse indigenous accounts of the conquest(s) of Mexico and Guatemala, things become much more complex, more disorienting. We are not sure if we are on the same ground, the same field of battle, the same narrow stone causeway before a Maya city, as we were a couple narratives ago. It makes a great difference whether your experience of, say, the conquest of Guatemala ends in a governorship, or in a poorly-attended to settlement far from home, spurned by your supposed&amp;nbsp;allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that seemed so important recede from view and others take their place; the &amp;#8216;local&amp;#8217; supersedes the grand tale; or, rather, everything is revealed as &amp;#8216;local,&amp;#8217; as particular. Knowing the boundaries, the markers, of your narrative, knowing what plot of ground you are standing on: this makes all the difference in the world, as much for understanding these multiple coexisting pasts as describing a wood lot or house plot. And the boundaries, like Pasquala Chi&amp;#8217;s forested lands, are themselves marked with ruins and edges of other things, promises of what lies behind the text before us, what lies beyond the bounds, under the overgrowth, between the&amp;nbsp;lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Did you know: things do fall apart and come back together and fall apart again. Some things matter more than others: the Spanish may keep local hierarchies intact, but it is not the same thing, is it? And perhaps many things can be tolerated- empires expand and contract, after all, and who can know the way things will work out after all. But some things matter a great deal more: the congregacion, for instance, does something especially troubling. It opens up questions that are painful to answer: &amp;#8216;When he comes to settle, will there be a house already there for him? And wheover settles on his land, will e not also apropriate for himself the fields? Where will he work land if they are entirely lost to him? And if he thus leaves behind his maize, chia, or cactus fruit, and his burial grounds, who will guard them for him? Will he not lose whatever he leaves behind?&amp;#8217; Gods can come and go, altapatl to cabildo, so be it- but the land, the mothering soil and seed and stock. This is something more, isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Did you know: there are thin traces, like the beloved&amp;#8217;s old campsite in the desert, running through all these texts. From the vivid quietly solemn and joyful dialogue for land from St. Michael, to the equally vivid and sorid tales of murder and hit-jobs gone awry, there are people, great and small, whose names and not much else- a story, a list of things, lands, relationships briefly mentioned- spread a narrow trace over the desert of the past. Some are especially poignant, even coming in unlikely places; you can almost feel the trace, or at least think you can: &amp;#8216;Here is another person, named Martin Itzcuin, from Mexicatzinco. His wife is named Ana Teiuc; their children are no longer alive. They came fifteen years ago. They live together with Catalina. All they did was try to make a living. He says: &amp;#8220;Let us be given a field on which we will pay tribute, we will not go back to our hometown, since we came [here] a long time&amp;nbsp;ago.&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Did you know: sometimes you wake up and realize how strange much of this must have been, at least at first, how fresh and foreign and yet familiar these events and processes and people appear. Cortes dressing up in feathers and golden ornaments; Japanese envoys escorted by a monk strolling through the streets of a rebuilt Mexico City; priests dug up out of the mountains offering children to rain deities. And so much familiar: squabbles in cabildos, power struggles in households and among neighbors, professions of faith and hope in the face of&amp;nbsp;death.&lt;/p&gt;

            <id>/history561/posts/indigenous-views-of-the-conquest.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Mesoamerican Voices: Native-Language Writings from Colonial Mexico, Oaxaca, Yucatan, and Guatemala, edited by Matthew Restall, Lisa Sousa, and Kevin Terraciano (all students of the august James Lockhart) presents a complicated, nuanced, deeply fascinating version of the Spanish conquest and the subsequent colonial period. Restall, Sousa, and Terraciano’s careful translation and invaluable contextualizing of the sources turns up the volume on Mesoamerican voices that can be very hard—if almost impossible—to hear in the Spanish&amp;nbsp;sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book begins with a brief note on method.  The editors express gratefulness to James Lockhart (xi), and discuss their method of translation and the ordering of the book.  They translate idiom not literally, but with attention to capturing its meaning.  They translate Spanish loanwords, except when they “represent a significant introduction to the material culture or conceptual vocabulary of the period” (xii).  But, they leave the Nahuatl word altepetl untranslated, and their explanation of why reveals the orientation of the book:  “we prefer to retain the original word in the translation and thereby challenge the reader to learn an important indigenous concept”&amp;nbsp;(xii). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introductory materials in the volume are nothing short of excellent.  They ensure that readers understand the localized nature of Mesoamerican identity, and how this influences the course of the conquest.  Localized identity is a key theme running through the documents, and it is difficult to overestimate its influence on the course of the conquest and New Spain.  In the Annals of Tlatelolco localized identity takes the form of obvious bitterness and rivalry toward the Mexica (43). Similarly, the Florentine Codex  notes that no one was sorry to see Moctezuma’s funeral pyre (37); there is no solidarity at the loss of an indigenous&amp;nbsp;leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influence of Lockhart on his students is clear. For example, though the authors do not use the Lockhart’s phrase “double mistaken identity,” the idea shines through.  The authors write of Christianity, “despite shared features and possibilities for identification between native religions and Christianity, even if native parishioners wanted to accept the new system, they were likely to misunderstand it or interpret many introductions in terms of deeply rooted cultural beliefs or ideologies” (175).  There is also a thoroughly Lockhartian analysis of documents such as wills and notarial records evident in the editors’ introductions to the&amp;nbsp;documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also apparent is the continuation of Restall’s myth-debunking.  Restall’s “Myth of Desolation” and “Myth of Completion” stand out in high relief here (for more see Matthew Restall, Seven Myths).  Indigenous communities continued to function much as they had before the conquest, despite new challenges like population decline resulting from disease.  The indigenous cabildo minutes from Tlaxcala, extant from 1547-1567, highlight this.  The Spanish required biannual elections of governors; the Tlaxcalans simply rotated the tlatoanis (indigenous rulers) from various parts of the altepetl (71, 73).  The take-home point here is that the same families were ruling on a local level—there was a great deal of continuity with the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not to imply that change did not occur.  Adaptations are revealed in the documents.  For example, under Spanish influence in the colonial period, the tax structure changes from an indigenous one in which nobles paid more tribute to what may be called a flat tax, where everyone pays regardless of ability (129).  Chimalpahin’s Diario, written from 1604-14, describes a Japanese diplomatic visit—and the indigenous author notes that some in the party are “idolators,” while others are baptized&amp;nbsp;(153).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing which stands out in the mind of this reader is the way that indigenous people were able to use the justice system in New Spain. Defenses asserted in the colonial period reveal a sophisticated understanding and manipulation of Spanish ideas about justice.  For example, one woman accused of adultery and attempted murder in 1581 defends her actions by saying, “the devil deceived me” (163).  In a Mixtec murder note from 1684, a man says he killed his wife because he caught her with the local sacristan—he is mounting a traditional European affirmative defense: that he committed what a modern jurist would call a “crime of passion” (163).  The Maya complain about priests who abuse their position and demand sexual favors from parishioners (168). Indigenous people can sue Spaniards, prosecute crimes against them, complain about mistreatment—and they&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;DO&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite corruption, abuses, and structural equalities in the system, this seems like a vast improvement on indigenous North Americans’ experiences with colonial English law. In fact, it could be argued that the entire indigenous experience of Spanish conquest and colonization was an improvement over the English version.  Restall has devoted his career to debunking the myths that surround this period of history—and in this book, you get the story “straight from the horse’s mouth,” so to speak.  Who better to tell indigenous history than indigenous&amp;nbsp;people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another note, Restall and Florine Asselberg’s Invading Guatemala takes down yet another myth—that Pedro Alvarado was the conqueror of Guatemala.  Despite his self-presentation as such in letters to Hernán Cortés—and the crown and history’s acceptance of it—the conquest of Guatemala was bloody and protracted.  It was not complete for&amp;nbsp;decades.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum, so much of what we think we know about the Spanish conquest is shrouded in myth. But hearing indigenous views on the subject goes a long way toward clearing the&amp;nbsp;mist.  &lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The two books for this week &lt;em&gt;Mesoamerican Voices &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Invading Guatemala offered&lt;/em&gt; a different twist than what we have been reading until now.  For the most all we have read is the Spanish accounts of what they did and why they did it.  In the books for this week we got a mix of both Spanish and Native&amp;nbsp;accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invading Guatemala &lt;/em&gt;depicted how horrible the conquest was.  Which seemed by far to be worse than that of Mexico.  If you take the friar’s account to be accurate Alvarado was a very sadistic man hell bent on exterminating everyone who he came in contact with.  But, this brings up another point who do you believe when you read these accounts?  Is one side right and the other wrong or is it really a matter of exaggeration on everyone’s part.  Another thing that struck me was how similar the letters addressed to the king were.  That same form of writing that pivotal to the Spanish account creeps its way into what the Native populations are writing.  But either way the way in which Restall and Asselberg present the information is intriguing.  They are able to combine both sets of writings in a coherent manner that place an almost checks and balance system on the account playing each off of each&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;em&gt;Mesoamerican Voices &lt;/em&gt;it is true paperwork is the norm no matter what culture you are in and often is only what is preserved.  It is kind of ironic our society is always obsessed with preserving beautiful things but in a few thousand years it may be more likely the day to day paperwork we drown ourselves in may be what survives, but I digress.  Restall, Sousa, and Terracino’s work pulls together the everyday means in which the native people of South  America lived.  During the conquest it was not clear how the Spanish would affect the local culture, however, afterwards it became abundantly clear.  The two cultures blended to become something almost new with deep ties to the past.  By presenting the native accounts under their topics the authors are able to show how people were adapting to the new culture.  While some of the accounts like the wills were a little daunting to get through it showed how the Spanish and South American systems of life, government, and religion possessed a basic&amp;nbsp;familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all the readings for this week were a fresh look at how the other half lived.  After weeks of Spanish accounts one begins to wonder if anything else existed.  So by reading these accounts and seeing how they both compared and contrasted I was able to fill out my vision of how the conquest affected everyone&amp;nbsp;involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;P.S.&lt;/span&gt; Everyone gets a special treat for tomorrows class  &lt;img src=&#39;http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif&#39; alt=&#39;:)&#39; class=&#39;wp-smiley&#39; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This weeks readings were a nice change, but also oddly familiar.  I suppose going in I though that these would be strictly indigenous, conquest and resistance related texts. (I know, I wasn’t apparently paying enough attention to Lockhart…)  In fact I must admit that I was looking forward to some hard-core “I hate you, you *&amp;amp;^%^%$ Spaniard” sort of texts.  But, as the Rolling Stones say, you can’t always get what you&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I tried and I do think I got what I needed.  &lt;em&gt;Mesoamerican Voices &lt;/em&gt;was, in a way, closer to what I expected.  Native-language writings (as the book’s title states) on various subjects that relate to life.  The power of the conquest is pretty evident in the forms adopted and adapted by indigenous peoples.  The Nahua, Maya and Mixtec peoples are certainly still negotiating their places in society, but they have been forced to adopt the forms of the conqueror…not so much new wines in old bottles, but entirely new beverages with completely different properties in those&amp;nbsp;bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read these, I couldn’t help but think of a concept enunciated by Dimitri Gutas in a book I read for another class: translation as a culturally creative concept.  The situations are not by any stretch of the imagination analogous, Gutas is explaining the cooptation of Greek and Sassanian ideology by early ‘Abbasid caliphs.  But the act of translation is a pretty general concept and since indigenous populations were able to at least exist within and comprehend the Spaniards perhaps this line of thought will bear some fruit.  Gutas sees translation as an ongoing, organic process with no clearly defined stages, beginnings or endings and this seems to fit with Lockhart and his student Restall’s conceptualization of the Conquest as a process and not an event.  What we have is essentially an ongoing negotiated dialogue, each side, while acting within understood social constructs, vying for all they can get.  Maybe this even works with Richard White’s idea of “creative misunderstandings” it seems to reflect the same understanding of cultural exchange.   Perhaps the &lt;em&gt;pays d’ en haute &lt;/em&gt;were not so different than the &lt;em&gt;probenzas &lt;/em&gt;of Mexico and early ‘Abbasid Baghdad, at lest in terms of the social and cultural implications of the translation of&amp;nbsp;ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to bounce around too much, but I suppose its time to jump of my theoretical trick pony and onto the Clydesdale of the Alvarado brothers.  Man, Pedro was mean.  I’m not sure if it is simply a difference in education, but in Alvarado’s letters he comes through as a cruel dude.  Cortez, I feel, could talk his way put of anything, but Alvarado reminds me of the letters of Oliver Cromwell, kill them and let God sort them out.  He even seems a little crazy with all his references to “evil plotting” though this is quite possibly just my&amp;nbsp;reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these texts came with a good interpretive apparatus, the first with nice pointers for those with lazy eyes and the second with a good, but brief historical description of the invasion of Guatemala.  I also really like hoe &lt;em&gt;Invading Guatelmala &lt;/em&gt;was made, the black section dividers were a nice touch, though I’m not sure why I like&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final note (neatly hidden at the end): Finally, after nearly ten years in college and five years of graduate school, I have had an epiphany.  Primary source documents are much more difficult to read than secondary sources.  Don’t get me wrong, I think I’ve always known this but had never really analyzed why I took more time and often felt bogged down while reading them.  After reading the different documents in both this week’s readings and really trying to figure out what it was that made me feel like the going was really slow I had this realization.  Not that this has a whole lot of relevance for the class, but I get excited when I figure things out about how I&amp;nbsp;work….&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;The well-chosen selections found in &lt;em&gt;Mesoamerican Voices &lt;/em&gt;represent, to my mind,  diverse and at times surprisingly poignant accounts of the Native American responses to the Spanish Conquest. Indeed, moving from Spanish accounts to indigenous accounts is reminiscent of moving from Crusader accounts (&amp;#8220;We rode in the blood of the Saracens up to the knees of our horses.&amp;#8221;) to Muslim poetic laments of the atrocities experienced. Here, Restall and his co-editors have uncovered every color of the human emotional spectrum, from mild amusement to disgust, and the resulting anthology is, I think,&amp;nbsp;splendid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the twelfth chapter of Book &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;XII&lt;/span&gt; of the Florentine Codex, for example, we witness, in an intimate way, the response of the Mexica to the Europeans&amp;#8217; attitude towards gold: &amp;#8220;Like monkeys they grabbed the gold. It was though their hearts were put to rest, brightened, renewed&amp;#8221; (29). On the one hand we must be careful to recognize sheer (and understandable) dislike and scorn when we read it. On the other, there is little doubt in my mind that, having marched and toiled through what was no doubt an uncomfortable and high-stress environment, the Spaniards were indeed overjoyed to find the precious metal, as anyone who works hard for something is thrilled to finally have it. Both the joy on the part of the conquistadors and the distaste on the part of the Mexica strike me as authentic human reactions, and serve to give the history of the Conquest a personal dimension heretofore seen only in&amp;nbsp;snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selection of brief documents also provide a reminder that the events we are examining in retrospect were lived in prospect. It is something every undergraduate history major should know, but something I, at least, am reminded of continuously. When the Tenocha argue among themselves and ask the agonizing question &amp;#8220;Will  they [our children] ever live to grow up?&amp;#8221; I am reminded of one of Restall&amp;#8217;s myths: that of completion. The so-called Conquest, with all its attending uncertainties, weighed on the  minds  of individuals for decades and, given the time frame of this volume, indeed&amp;nbsp;centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chapter on religious life was, for me, especially revealing-perhaps a necessary reminder, in this secular age, of the varieties of religious experience, as William James put it. We encounter the unpleasant example of the four fornicating friars, and can only assume that their exploits permanently tarnished Christianity in the minds of potential converts. And we also see the late seventeenth century example of Angelina, who bequeaths her houses to various saints in an act of sincere piety that shows no traces of indigenous religion, at least to my non-specialist&amp;nbsp;eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restall and Asselberg&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Invading Guatemala &lt;/em&gt;is a fascinating account&amp;#8211;aided by the succinct and well-written introduction&amp;#8211;of a would-be Cortes, Pedro de Alvarado. From the text, we gather that he was impressed with, and no doubt envious of, Cortes&amp;#8217; success in the Valley of Mexico, and sought to duplicate or surpass the earlier achievement in Guatemala. Alvarado&amp;#8217;s letters to Cortes reveal a man of terrific ambition (and perhaps a dangerous temper), but one who (for whatever this may be worth) makes a point of praising the Spaniards accompanying him, shows respect for their endurance, and continually sent his own brother and cousin out on the most dangerous assignments (for which, as it turns out, they received very little reward). Bernal Diaz, for his part, portrays Alvarado as one who &amp;#8220;displayed good will toward the &lt;em&gt;caciques&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;(65).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nahua acounts, however, are for me the most revelatory in this anthology. The Tlaxcalan letter to the King of 1547, for example, follows the standard epistolary format verbatim, complete with the honorific &amp;#8220;Holy Catholic and Caesarean Royal Majesty&amp;#8221; (83). Their plight is severe, and the desperation evident: &amp;#8220;Therefore, having seen and heard the very good and beneficial services done for your Majesty, we humbly implore you&amp;#8230;[to] remember us, the poor and miserable, exhausted from such prolonged labors&amp;#8230;.&amp;#8221; (84). Not only to the Tlaxcalans have nowhere else to turn&amp;#8211;bring up the question as to the extent they truly considered themselves Spanish subjects&amp;#8211;but they considered themselves to be, andin fact &lt;em&gt;were themselves&lt;/em&gt;, conquistadores. It is something I was aware of intellectually, but the beauty of primary sources is their ability to express the reality of it. In the vernacular: primary sources drive the point&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mesoamerican Voices &lt;/em&gt;presents a different view of the conquest by examining the voices of Native Americans, focusing on the themes of diversity and shared historical experiences. Mesoamerican society was complex, the editors claim, because of the diverse geography of the region. Though the Spanish imposed their rule, Mesoamericans typically found ways to carry on many of the same practices, often combining the new and traditional. The assimilation was often gradual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using sources such as letters, wills, political minutes, and legal testimonies, the editors examine many aspects of Native culture, concluding that aspects of society from political to legal to religious largely found ways to fuse traditions. For example, the heads of the cabildo were typically rotated between already established nobles. Other documents prove that Native culture was complex and worthy of being called civilized, as reflected by complex moral and philosophical codes. The work speaks to the true nature of the conquest, that the Mesoamerican population was not truly overcome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An interesting juxtaposition of assimilation is found in the fact that one of the easiest religious ideas to accept was the idea of a large cult of saints. Perhaps a more complex acceptance can be seen in the Catholic idea of penitence, as seen on page 156, “&amp;#8230; perhaps what is happening to people, disease or something else, or whatever it should be that is frightening and shocking, wherever such things happen to people as have happened to us here in Mexico now, happens because of our sins, perhaps through his anger, and is fitting.” The idea of an angry god taking vengeance on sinful subjects is nothing new to Mesoamericans. All that is missing is the required sacrifices to pacify the god.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invading Guatemala &lt;/em&gt;focuses strictly on the actual fighting, providing firsthand accounts of the Spanish conquest of Guatemala, portraying it as much more violent than that of Mexico. The first part of the work establishes the background, chiefly explaining the success of the conquest, which was actually only a tenuous triumph until the second wave, as a result of the Spanish use of Nahua allies over a region not consolidated as commonly assumed, but full of infighting. The editors then turn to the firsthand account to bust the myths of the Spanish conquest of Guatemala. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first section features the letters of Pedro de Alvarado, which seem little more than the self-justifying bravado of Cortes. The subsequent Spanish texts show a slightly different picture, that the conquest was much more difficult than portrayed by Alvarado, that he was not the one primarily responsible for the conquest (though publishing seems to have established him as the victor), and that the conquest was much more barbarous than portrayed, perhaps bordering on genocide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nahua accounts portray them as equal allies in the conquest who received much less than they bargained for in the partnership. The Maya accounts portray the brutality of the conquest and the subsequent disillusionment of those that allied themselves with the Spanish. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how does the reader reconcile such drastically different claims? Even with the claims not written by the Spanish, the motives must be addressed. A historian must function as something of an intellectual police interrogator, sifting through presentations that purposefully twist the truth to their own ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the specific myth of a quick conquest, Bernal Diaz compares Alvarado to Alexander the Great. Robin Lane Fox, a biographer of Alexander, claims that he conquered little more than the main roads of Asia, leaving the power structure largely intact as long as the conquered paid tribute. Perhaps if that is the standard by which Alvarado and other Europeans measured their conquests, this one was successful.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-647395264051810131?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The New World&amp;#8221; has always struck me as being nothing more than a pretty euphemism or a piece of Renaissance-style Latin hyperbole.  Reading Lockhart&amp;#8217;s work on American languages last week, and now this week reading native texts has shattered this notion for me.  I now appreciate that the Americas were in fact an alien land to Europeans, that the Americas might as well have been&amp;nbsp;Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language shapes the way we see the world.  Terms for abstract concepts, social structures, and complex relationships necessarily convey information beyond merely providing a convenient label for a thing.  Grammatical forms, especially those expressing states of being, the possession of attributes and characteristics, and the relationship between objects and action vary from language to language, and these forms contain an inherent (and typically unconscious) cosmology.  By learning a language, especially a first or native language, one is indoctrinated into a way of viewing the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording a language by means of graphic symbols complicates this.  For one thing, we tend to label this process &amp;#8220;writing,&amp;#8221; and then impart onto it all of the subconscious meanings associated with &amp;#8220;writing&amp;#8221; in our own culture.  For example, we automatically assume that language recorded by means of graphic symbols is meant to exactly mirror spoken language, or we assume that it is mean to be read silently by an individual reader, or that it is intended to have a single meaning.  These, of course, are false assumptions, and as we learn more about how pre-modern societies employed &amp;#8220;writing,&amp;#8221; it is becoming clear that the modern concept of &amp;#8220;writing&amp;#8221; is an&amp;nbsp;aberration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encounter between the Spanish and the various indigenous people of the Americas, then, really was the meeting of different linguistic and cognitive worlds.  Reading about native languages from Lockhart, and now reading native language texts, I now appreciate the alterity of the Americas.  Additionally, it strikes me that the Conquest brought with it a linguistic imperialism, that even allowing for double mistaken identity, the Conquest was in part the imposition of an Italic cognitive world onto a Mesoamerican&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;First off, reading Lockhar&amp;#8217;s collection of essays, &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=zIK3og4-apEC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=Of+things+of+the+indies&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=DQ4avA74on&amp;amp;sig=3b_sbTnRJ9s6rMVPilmzSZOGEUQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=IGODS_6hF5GXtgfh8vXTAg&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;Of Things of the Indies&lt;/a&gt;, was a pleasure. Even though I wasn&amp;#8217;t terribly familiar with all of the topics he covers, Lockhart is a fine writer and capable of conveying even rather foreign topics with great verve and skill, without sacrificing his strong analytical acumen. His analysis often times seems to operate almost from within the world of his subjects. He conveys a sense of getting inside the texts he examines, and by extension, getting inside- in some small but often exhilarating manner- the world from which his texts hail. Lockhart describes in his closing autobiographical/historiographical-ish essay a sense he cultivated first in Germany of aculturating himself to initially foreign cultures and languages (shades of Geertz perhaps to be seen here), and he clearly continues that in much of his work. His close readings of the sources, always with an analytical eye to how the texts are working and what they might be saying and leaving unsaid, allows him to reconstruct, in some measure, the social world of early Latin America. In order to demonstrate the how of his &amp;#8216;method&amp;#8217; of doing history, Lockhart presents a truly enjoyable section-by-section analysis of three early Latin American texts- my favorite essay in the book. Not only does Lockhart reveal, in quite meticulous, close-up detail, the traces of Spanish, African, and indigenous lives (and the intersections of those), but he shows how he is doing it. You can feel with him the excitement of coming across the traces, however ephemeral and brief, of real peoples&amp;#8217; lives and concerns and ways of doing&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for more specific topics, a few thoughts and some possible analogues with my own fields of study. I found his concept of Double Mistaken Identity fascinating and perhaps useful in my own examinations of Islamic interactions with non-Islamic peoples in the first several centuries of Islam. In the aftermath of the Arab &lt;em&gt;futuh&lt;/em&gt; of Christian and Persian lands, there are various points at which Muslims express what they think to be a correct understanding of &amp;#8216;indigenous&amp;#8217; forms but are in fact their own particular concepts projected over others, something that becomes particularly acute after the invasions of the Indian subcontinent. Likewise, initial Christian encounters with Islam necessitate a reaction and contextualization of the new religion; in many cases Christians carry operate on the premises of mistaken identity, whereby they fit Muhammad and his book and religion into pre-existing Christian categories, through which, in some ways, they are able to explain and cope with the presence of the new rulers and their faith. It&amp;#8217;s not an exact fit, of course, with what Lockhart is describing, but I think his model is potentially useful elsewhere. As he notes, the dynamics of cultural interchange and clash are not unique to Latin America, but are in some ways&amp;nbsp;global.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another close analogue with Christian-Islamic interactions, and one with Lockhart does not develop in detail, is the reaction of Franciscans and other Spanish ecclesiastics to Nahuatl texts, which Lockhart describes as coming from both their desire to indoctrinate the indigenous, but also a genuine interest and love of the indigenous languages and literature.  Here the connection is perhaps in fact genealogical: I was immediately reminded of Western medieval Christian reactions to the Qur&amp;#8217;an and Islamic literature, as examined by Thomas Burman in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14318.html&#34;&gt;Reading the Qur&amp;#8217;an in Latin Christendom&lt;/a&gt;. Burman looks at a wide range of reactions to and uses of the Qur&amp;#8217;an and its translation from Arabic to Latin, including translators who seem to be interested in Arabic and the Qur&amp;#8217;an because they genuinely find it interesting. Burman also examines the role of Arabic-speaking Muslims in aiding Latin Christian translators, and the ensuing traces that result in their translations. Some translations, long dismissed as paraphrases, are in fact reflective of Islamic exegetical traditions, as transmitted either through Christian translators&amp;#8217; contacts with Muslims or familiarity with their exegetical literature. Likewise, it seems from Lockhart&amp;#8217;s analysis of the Spanish translation of the Florentine Codex that a similar process is very much at work, with native speakers aiding in the meaningful rendering of the Nahuatl texts into Spanish, and not simply literal&amp;nbsp;equivalence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I find Lockhart&amp;#8217;s discussion of &amp;#8216;resistance&amp;#8217; particularly useful vis-a-vis the Islamic conquest of Eastern Christian lands. While it can be tempting to impose modern constructions of resistance and colonialism upon these settings, as Lockhart argues, such an imposition is ultimately anachronistic and does little justice to the complex realities &amp;#8216;on the ground,&amp;#8217; where cultures- on all sides- were not static, nor universally impacted in the same ways, but experienced a process of give-and-take, with varying levels of exposure to Spanish forms and action, varying levels of adaptation and use, and some manifestations- sporadic and rooted in indigenous institutions- of violence against Spanish rule, though not as &amp;#8216;resistance&amp;#8217; in the sense some would like to find. Rather, these acts of &amp;#8216;resistance&amp;#8217; were themselves manifestations of concerns for &amp;#8216;ancient liberties&amp;#8217; and other forms of privilege ultimately rooted in indigenous polities and social forms. Here as elsewhere the dynamic of Double Mistaken Identity allowed for the penetration by Spanish authorities and forms of indigenous organizations, while the relative autonomy of those organizations and institutions since the seeming penetration was so often only surface deep. Beneath the surface life could go on in ways not terribly unlike before. At the same time, though, the impact of Spanish culture and administration did not decrease, but gradually increased the pressure on indigenous institutions and culture, including language- as exemplified by Lockhart&amp;#8217;s three stages theory. In the end, Spanish culture would deeply transform much of indigenous life- but not overnight, and not through sudden&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;conquest.&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;In writing this blog I think it is prudent to take the readings in how I felt they were helpful to read.  I began reading Lockhart but soon got a little lost in the terminology, so to remedy this situation I switched to the selections written by Gibson.  Gibson’s work I found much more of an explanatory process for someone who is new to the field to understand.  I found the information Gibson provided to be enlightening.  Especially when it came to forming a background for what Lockhart has written.  I have been in need of a little more background on the different groups of native people which were present during the contact period.  Gibson’s analyses of how the different groups conceptualize there own unique history was fascinating.  All in all, I found Gibson’s sections to be very helpful and presented the information on a good&amp;nbsp;level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockhart’s &lt;em&gt;Of Things of the Indies &lt;/em&gt;there were several competing factors that for me were both interesting and perplexing.  To begin with, as with all complied essay books I have a fear that the organization will be lacking and confuse the hell out of me.  However,  I found that the progression of Lockhart’s chapters followed a very linear line and related to each other in a very coherent way.  And I very much appreciated this aspect of the&amp;nbsp;book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the book that I liked was how Lockhart talks about what other people have written and/or researched.  The progression of a historiography is a somewhat new feature to me and reading this book helped to clarify how things work on this level.  I will admit that this on more than one occasion came out a little heavy and I would have liked to have seen a little more explanation about what he was discussing.  So in this respect the book it not quite how I thought it would&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the content of what the essays were designed to discuss I was conflicted in my attitude towards it.  Ah the linguistics.  I will admit linguistics is an aspect of anthropology that will always elude me, so as a consequence I didn’t get as much out of what he discussed.  But, it is good that he takes this approach to how he studies the history of the area.  The other aspects such as the interweaving of the cultures and how systems were formed in New Spain were very interesting.  And seeing as I have been experimenting with social memory theory for my thesis his explanation of social history hit a few familiar cords with my own&amp;nbsp;research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is however, one aspect of the book I’m taking issue with, his discussion of anthropologists at the end especially the archaeologists.   I realize that he is trying to relate how his own research developed over time and that’s fine it is a good way to wrap up the book and show how he came to his conclusions.  But, the tone he took with my field was a little harsh.  He blames us for what we had not done or were not doing or were leaving out of our research.  During this he referred to the 1960s and grant it our history prior to that time was neglecting in how we studied things.  But, I don’t think that Lock hart gives us enough credit for where the discipline as a whole was heading.  From the 60s onward was a time of new theories and methods which have revolutionized how we understand cultures and conduct research.  And as for archaeology it is always going to be the study of physical objects and that is never going to change so it should be left up to others to study the finer details of written documents.  There is a reason why anthropology is such a specialized field.  It is impossible to study all aspects of a culture cause in the end you will fail and neglect the culture you are studying.  So by having an almost fragmented personality in anthropology allows us to look at a culture from all sides and then compare notes and figure out what it is going on.  It is not that I hate Lockhart’s interpretation of his research but I would prefer it if he did not accuse us of not doing things when those theoretical paradigms were being&amp;nbsp;developed.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This week I left behind the gory priests and hardy adventurers of the Conquest of Mexico and began to peel back the layers of the social history of early modern Latin America.  Though I may catch flack for this, I have to say the change was welcome…or maybe the weather had something to do with my mood as well. Blue skies and warm weather almost always beat clouds and cold, at least in my book.  I read James Lockhart’s collected essays first and got quite a bit out of them.  Though I should probably look this up, it seems that he is an important figure in the historiography of the era.  Hat he can put forth a 300+ page book of his work does not necessarily make him a great scholar, but the proof is in the reading.  It was interesting to see the ebb and flow of his intellect over a thirty year period.  While his last essay/ professional memoir summarizes the changes in the field and perhaps even history as a whole, the remainder of the essays offers the same view at a much less general level.  As far as I can tell Lockhart’s scope touches on about everything without neglecting anything within a given category.  Institutions, economics, narratives, culture, language, linguistics, historiography, and even the profession itself are within his body of work and he treats all of them admirably.  This book seems like it will be a nice foundation in that it picks up where the narrative histories left off.   The Conquest didn’t happen, it continued.  One concept in particularly struck a chord with me, his idea of a “double mistaken identity”.  This sounds really similar to Richard White’s idea of the “middle ground” with his “creative misunderstandings” and both men were publishing these ideas at around the same time so it’s interesting to note the similarities. (Now that I actually look for the note it seems that Lockhart cited White).  Overall I felt satisfied with a filling chunk of Lockhart-ness.&lt;br /&gt;
    Gibson’s work was similarly fulfilling.  Though from an earlier generation than Lockhart’s latest essays, he still helps out a person who has never read anything about the early colonial period in Mexico.  His focus is less culture than the institutions and interaction between people(s) within said institutions.&lt;br /&gt;
    The question with which I want to wrestle at this point is the distinction between event and process. Obviously in a purely martial and narrative sense the Conquest happened.  Of course this definition is contingent on the use of the definitions written by the likes of Prescott, Diaz, and (in a perhaps less ultimately triumphant sense) Cortes.  Yet the processes begun and redirected by these individuals through both pens and swords continued, as Lockhart and Gibson attest.  The major difference that I see is a difference in sources.  Is this difference a function of the goal of the writer? I think that it is.    Wills, legal cases, essentially bureaucratic documents relay more information of the individuals being conquered than the narrative histories. This leads to an evolving diachronic view of the Conquest. Again I will be somewhat general here, but, when the fighting stopped the “fighting” did not end. So I wonder…Is the grand narrative of the Conquest which focuses on its completion an essentially synchronic “thing” or a process which has only been studied from one&amp;nbsp;perspective? &lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;As a fan of good narrative histories, and considering that strong narrative skills are not overly valued within my own field, I often find myself unfairly assuming that, while both narrative and analytical abilities are crucial to the study of history, pieces of historical analysis are somehow less readable than narrative texts. Fortunately, both Charles Gibson and James Lockhart have once again reminded me of that presumptive&amp;nbsp;fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selections from Gibson&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule&lt;/em&gt; provide a welcome, and necessary complement to the chronicle of Bernal Diaz del Castilo, the narrative of William H. Prescott, and the epistolary writings of Cortes himself. The author begins, appropriately enough, with geography. The descriptions of the Valley of Mexico abound in the aforementioned sources, but the modern reader is rightfully skeptical as to their veracity. For that matter, aside from a comment or two in the introductions, the non-specialist reader may well be unsure as to what, precisely, comprises the Valley of Mexico. Gibson&amp;#8217;s work, as he describes it, is about change, and the physical changes of the Valley of Mexico well serves as a metaphor to describe how European and Mesoamerican civilizations inaugurated the history of Latin America. In addition to the statistics of annual rainfall, agricultural fertility, and impressive population density (more than three hundred persons per square mile [p.5]), Gibson describes, albeit too briefly, the Spanish attempts and successes (using Indian labor) at civil engineering in Tenochtitlan/Mexico City, centuries-long effort at cutting a wall in the Valley, opening the basin to the sea.  The author expresses an appreciation for the different mediums through which archaeologists and historians go about their work to study pre- and post-conquest Mexico, which is fitting, since his work is about how two distinct cultures merged, if&amp;nbsp;imperfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibson&amp;#8217;s impressive second chapter, on the various tribes of central Mexico, cannot be fully understood by a single reading. To this non-specialist, it is a remarkable piece of delineation and explanation that may deserve to stand along as a supplementary piece in a Latin American or world history survey course; certainly it dispells any notion of the indigenous inhabitants of preconquest Mexico as in any way monolithic. Similarly, Gibson&amp;#8217;s discussion of the emcomiendas in Chapter Four ably describes the evolution of social and political perrogatives in New Spain, including the ambiguities and conflicts resulting from that evolution (although his assertion that the encomienda system was, in essence, benign vis a vis the Indians merits further commentary early on, though he later addresses in detail both the abuses of ecomienda society and the fine line between de jure and de facto&amp;nbsp;slavery).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no doubt easier to describe periods of relative stasis (i. e., the fifty years preceeding the Conquest) than times of transtition (the half-century after the Conquest), but Gibson pulls it off. &amp;#8220;This was the time,&amp;#8221; he writes, &amp;#8220;when Indian peoples, or some of them, met the Spanish influence part way and reached positive degrees of cultural accord&amp;#8221; (404).  Furthermore, both societies were anything but unified as concerned possible responses to the other. Gibson&amp;#8217;s analysis describes the confusion of those decades in an articulate and revealing way, and shed much additional light on the earlier&amp;nbsp;narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Lockhart&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Of Things of the Indies&lt;/em&gt; is, similarly, a welcome complement to the narrative sources of the Conquest, but this collection of essays reads, naturally enough, quite diffrently. Certain chapters may be more accesssible to scholars of the period (Chapter 10, &amp;#8220;Some Unfashionable Ideas on the History of the Nahuatl Language,&amp;#8221; for example), but others are wonderfully informative in their own right. Chapter 5 places the various uses of American resources in their contexts, including &amp;#8220;who the immigrants were and what were their goals and needs&amp;#8221; (121). In fact, Lockhart&amp;#8217;s volume reads as a more subtle version of Restall&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquesti. &lt;/em&gt;The immigrants, for example&amp;#8211;a term Lockhart consideres at least as accurate as &amp;#8220;conqueror&amp;#8221;&amp;#8211;are addressed based on Lockhart&amp;#8217;s own earlier studies, and it is refreshing to read a scholar who questions whether religious fervor was a conscious, unbiquitous, motivating factor in the appropriation of native resources: &amp;#8220;The religious beliefs of the majority&amp;#8230;in no way inpeded or even affected their economic activity&amp;#8221; (126). Similarly, the early desire for gold (before silver came to dominate) was not the result of a simple &amp;#8220;medieval&amp;#8221; affinity with the shiny metal, but a pragmatic need for cash&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the volume, Lockhart makes it clear he views himself as a social historian, and his essay on the merchants of early Latin America describes the evolution, or rather importation, of the different stages of the merchant classes (as well as the companies for which they worked), thus suporting his argument that ecomonic history is a root of social history. (I am not sure I agree, but Lockhart supports his assertion more than&amp;nbsp;adequately.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close, Lockhart prvides a thoroughlly enjoyable and thoroughly subjective memoir-essay describing his own path to the historical profession. I am not sure is fits in with the earlier essays in this anthology&amp;#8211;in fact, I am sure it does not&amp;#8211;but, to this hopeful novice, &amp;#8220;A Historian and the Disciplines&amp;#8221; provides both a breath of fresh air and, once again, serves to illustrate the fact that we all write from the perspective of the times in which we live and&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;James Lockhart&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Of Things of the Indies &lt;/em&gt;is a collection of essays written at the end of a distinguished career in conquest history. In many ways, it can be read as a book surveying the state of the field, as many essays seem much like historiographical surveys. A lot can be learned by someone not familiar with the field from such studies, though it must be gleaned between the lines. The other half of the essays deal with direct topics such as emigration trends, cross-cultural contact and its effects on those contacted, and the pragmatic use of resources in the developing economy. The book does shatter many time-honored myths about the conquest of Mexico, and other American locales, but might not be the easiest way to approach the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What stands out to me is Lockhart&amp;#8217;s timetable for assimilation of Spanish culture by the Nahua, expressed most clearly on page 209. Stage one, the initial contact, saw little change. The second stage, 1540-50 to 1650-60, saw corporations primarily affected and Hispanic items enter Nahua culture discreetly. The third stage, after 1650, saw the two societies integrate on an intimate, widespread level. While Lockhart is careful to say this process does not hold true for other areas, it does say a lot about the nature of the conquest. The first true effects were in business, suggesting the Spanish were not primarily motivated by glory or religion, but by personal gain, shattering many myths of the conquest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On page 313, Lockhart discusses the Native American view of the Spanish, essentially claiming that they did not believe the Spanish would transform society but were the equivalent of just another local power fighting for dominance. That being the case, they could support or reject them depending on their current political needs. The theory, expressed in a paragraph, makes more sense of the Spanish success in procuring allies than any narrative studied so far. The chapter also sheds light on the slow assimilation of Christian culture into native religion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gibson’s &lt;em&gt;Aztecs Under Spanish Rule &lt;/em&gt;is an excellent practical look at Mexican society in the aftermath of the conquest. Or rather, it provides an excellent glance at the continually shifting Mexican society in the aftermath of the conquest. The changes, from ecology to population, are attributed by Gibson solely to human contact. The study focuses strictly on the Valley of Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After summarizing pre-conquest society, the selections examine the complex tribal network and how it was ripe for Spanish exploitation (whether Cortes knew it or not), the system of towns, and the shift from encomienda to corregimiento. In all cases, native culture displayed a remarkable ability to adapt and survive, shooting holes in Gibson’s initial classification of Mexican society as defeated. Indeed, the work seems to show that there was no real conquest, just two sides finding ways to adapt to the other, reaching something of a compromise. Though to be fair, no one would suggest that the Spanish got anything but the best parts of the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An especially interesting part for this class was Cortes&amp;#8217; refusal to give up the encomienda. Having just read narratives portraying Cortes as a selfless hero in service of God and country, his defiance of royal decree speaks completely to the opposite.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-4075607275394520114?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;What a relief to read Lockhart and Gibson!  It was refreshing to delve into the subject from the perspective of twentieth century historians who had the advantage of modern methods and access to a wider variety of&amp;nbsp;sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockhart’s research into Nahuatl documents informed his work, with brilliant results.   His greater knowledge of indigenous culture allows him to move beyond traditional interpretations that take the conquerors at face value, toward a clearer understanding of the indigenous experience of conquest.&lt;br /&gt;
Convergence is key—for it was the common ground shared between native American and Spanish cultures that allowed the history of the conquest and subsequent colonial period to develop as it&amp;nbsp;did.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockhart sees convergence of cultures, not the tragic clash of two worlds that somehow inevitably led to native decline and desolation.  Instead of assuming unilateral resistance to all things foreign on the part of the conquered, Lockhart points out that people instead reacted in pragmatic, logical ways that depended on their culture, situation and&amp;nbsp;options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Lockhart’s research into indigenous languages has allowed him a wider perspective than historians who went before him.  His linguistic analysis of Nahuatl is quite impressive.  As someone with a rudimentary understanding of linguistics—and some exposure to the Quechua language that Lockhart touches on as a complement to the Nahuatl experience—I am able to appreciate the remarkable amount and quality of work that Lockhart has done in this area.  He was ahead of his time—and he paved the way for a future generation of scholars of the indigenous language.&lt;br /&gt;
This is what the New Philology (also called the Lockhart School) is all about—blurring disciplinary boundaries and looking at indigenous language and history in its own context, on its own&amp;nbsp;terms.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Restall&amp;nbsp;writes, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Simply put, the New Philology includes those students of the ethnohistory of colonial Mesoamerica whose scholarship is based on native-language sources (the vast majority hitherto unstudied), who emphasize a broadly philological (i.e., historical-linguistic) analysis of those sources, and who subscribe to the view that the study of native-language sources is crucial to understanding indigenous societies. The school is thus both a model and a method, with the &amp;#8220;New&amp;#8221; referring to the innovation both of emphasizing native roles in colonial history through the study of native-language sources (the model) and of analyzing those sources philologically (the method).&amp;#8221; (Matthew Restall, “A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History,” Latin American Research Review 38, no 1 (2003), 113-134,&amp;nbsp;114)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Lockhart does when he “reads between the lines.”  Importantly, this is a method that other scholars can apply to their own work, not just to indigenous language sources, but wherever a fresh and deep analysis of documents is called&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://masalladelnapo.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/51gxx969s5l-_sl500_aa240_.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://masalladelnapo.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/51gxx969s5l-_sl500_aa240_.jpg?w=240&amp;#038;h=240&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;51GXX969S5L._SL500_AA240_&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-46&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon its publication in 1964, Aztecs Under Spanish Rule by Charles Gibson was recognized as a groundbreaking work of ethnohistory.  First of all, Gibson establishes a pattern of pre-contact conquests in the Mexican valley.  He writes, “For centuries, the rise and fall of tribes in the valley of Mexico had been governed by military victory and defeat, and the expansion and reduction of controlled areas had been reciprocal, complementary processes” (20-21).  Still, he sees the Spanish conquest as a fundamental break with the past, characterized by resource depletion and the exploitation of indigenous&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibson begins with an exploration of the geography and archaeology of the central Mexican valley.  Next, he discusses the pre-contact patterns of conquest, in which the Mexica defeated the rival tribal power at Tenochtitlan in the 1400s, and the anti-Mexica politics of the years preceding the arrival of Cortés.  Gibson points out that the Tlaxcalans attacked Tenochtitlan two years before they would repeat the process as Spanish allies.&amp;nbsp;(12-18)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a chapter on the fate of large tribal units after the militaristic phase of the conquest, Gibson discusses towns.   Cabaceras, or “head towns” in Spanish, contained subunits called sujetos, or communities owing tribute to the cabaceras.  These were intended to replicate pre-contact divisions of empire, and Gibson argues, “the irregularities were of Indian, not of Spanish origin” (47).  He sees the late eighteenth-century decline of the cabecera-sujeta system as “Indian yielding to Spanish institutions,” or the “rejection of Indian institutions”&amp;nbsp;(57).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter Four discusses the encomienda and corregimiento.  The Spanish crown granted an area of tribute-collecting in the encomienda, and Gibson emphasizes Spanish abuses of the system, saying that the mid-sixteenth century escheatment of the encomiendas was due to Indian resistance as much as restrictions by the crown (62-4). After the 1530s the coregimiento functioned as an alternative to the encomienda, with Indians placed under the jurisdiction of the crown and beneath the supervision of a salaried officer called the encomendero, who earned much of his income from extralegal manipulation of the&amp;nbsp;situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibson has mined the archives for colonial documents and utilizes traditional sources like the chronicles of Gómara and the letters of Cortés.  He also takes advantage of numerous secondary sources and new information from, for example, radiocarbon dates.  His work surpasses what came before it and breaks new ground that allows James Lockhart and others to pursue important social&amp;nbsp;history.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Gibson does not escape the Black Legend.  He writes, “The Black Legend provides a gross but essentially accurate interpretation of relations between the Spanish and the Indians” (403). Because of his identification with the Black Legend, Gibson highlights both discontinuity with the past and Indian “resistance” (which Lockhart has revealed to be a tricky concept, indeed).  He sees “a record of deliberate sadism” (403) and one-sided exploitation and manipulation, and ends with the assertion that because they were so desolated, “few peoples in the whole of history were more prone to drunkenness than the Indians of the Spanish colony”&amp;nbsp;(409).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, Gibson offers a very useful discussion of pre-Columbian politics and provides illuminating glimpses into early colonial organization and government.  Aztecs Under Spanish Rule was an important book that laid a foundation for future&amp;nbsp;research.  &lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://masalladelnapo.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/images.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://masalladelnapo.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/images.jpeg?w=65&amp;#038;h=96&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;images&#34; width=&#34;65&#34; height=&#34;96&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-41&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twelve essays in this volume date from 1969 to 1999, and highlight the progression of seminal historian James Lockhart’s work from Social History to New&amp;nbsp;Philology.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of the essays date to Lockhart’s early career, such as “Encomienda and Hacienda” and “The Social History of Early Latin America,” the latter of which Lockhart wrote in 1972 to use in teaching graduate level historiography of the conquest.  Other chapters are distillations of material from Lockhart’s books.  Chapters 9-12 are published here for the first time, offering fresh insights into Lockhart’s theory and methodology, which is interdisciplinary in nature but owes much to history and&amp;nbsp;linguistics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the volume, Lockhart emphasizes the importance of convergence of Spanish and indigenous ideas and cultures.  Where there was the greatest convergence between cultures, people proved the most receptive to acculturation.  Lockhart writes, “In all of these matters, the basic determinants are the fit of European and indigenous culture and the contact between the two populations” (331).  Lockhart makes the point that reception was not entirely one-sided; indigenous culture lent Latin American culture much of its distinctive&amp;nbsp;flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essay on “Double Mistaken Identity” illustrates the way that convergence and accommodation worked.  Because of the congruence between Mesoamerican and Iberian cultural forms, each group found much that seemed familiar in the other.  Lockhart explains, “At the heart of the interaction was a process I call Double Mistaken Identity, in which each side of the cultural exchange presumes that a given form or concept is functioning in the way familiar within its own tradition and is unaware of or unimpressed by the other side’s interpretation” (99).  For example, Lockhart considers the role of witnesses to official documents.  Spanish practice dictated that three men witness a document’s authenticity.  The Nahuas readily adopted the Spanish juridical form, but retained their own meaning.  They preferred multiple witnesses of both genders who “not only attested to … formal legality … but actually assented to the justice of the proceeding” (109), infusing the custom with Nahua ideas about&amp;nbsp;law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the book deals with Lockhart’s intense study of Nahua linguistics. He discusses three stages of Nahua language and cultural acquisition, which he discerned from patterns in Nahuatl documents.  Stage 1, from Contact to c. 1540, is characterized by little cultural change; Stage 2, c. 1540 to 1650, involves the massive loan of nouns to Nahuatl from Spanish; and Stage 3 finally witnesses large-scale bilingualism (209).  Cultural developments seem to parallel those of language, and the sequence occurs, with some variation, across&amp;nbsp;regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to understand that, in all of this, Lockhart sees both indigenous and Spanish actors responding rationally and pragmatically to the situations they confronted.  For example, sedentary versus migratory peoples logically reacted differently to the Spanish presence because it affected them differently.  There was much more convergence between sedentary indigenous groups and the Spanish, and their way of life would not change abruptly under Spanish rule.  Migratory groups, however, organized their society very differently and were able to launch surprise attacks on the Spanish precisely because they were not tied to a single place.  Likewise, the Spanish chose to establish a presence among sedentary peoples who lived in proximity to rich mineral deposits.  The second most powerful group in a region tended to ally with the Spanish (like the Tlaxcalans against Tenochtitlán), because that was the best strategy for maintaining their independence.  As Lockhart explains, “most groups and most members of those groups were simply thinking of the greatest good and largest quotient of independence they could attain within the situation as they had always known it, not of resistance to an outsider”&amp;nbsp;(308).  &lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Whenever I would read a seminal work of historical scholarship as an undergraduate, I would instantly want to be a historian of whatever field or era the study was about.  It had been a long time since I&amp;#8217;d had that feeling until I read James Lockhart&amp;#8217;s Of Things of the Indies.  If I&amp;#8217;d read this eight or nine years ago, I might have decided to be a historian of early Latin&amp;nbsp;America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than try to compose a single commentary on a collection of many articles, I will instead offer some thoughts on those articles that made a strong impression on&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;A Historian and the&amp;nbsp;Disciplines&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, Lockhart discusses something that I&amp;#8217;ve been pondering for a while &amp;#8211; why are the humanities arranged into disciplines?  I realize, of course, that the answer has to do with the growth of the university and the development of scholarship as institutions, and even more importantly, that the business of academia is so entrenched in these disciplines that they will not ever go away.  Still, Lockhart&amp;#8217;s point that he had little to do with most of his peers in the history department that employed him while he had a great deal of contact with anthropologists and linguists should at least demonstrate the importance of creating inter-disciplinary bodies to bring together scholars in different disciplines working in the same&amp;nbsp;field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;A Double Tradition: Editing Book Twelve of the Florentine Codex&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Between the Lines&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; the Paleography&amp;nbsp;Articles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these two articles, Lockhart brings his audience with him as he delves into the nuances of studying the written word in the pre-modern world.  &amp;#8220;Between the Lines&amp;#8221; is particularly fascinating as the presentation of a three case studies on how to study a manuscript in early Spanish Peru.  Lockhart&amp;#8217;s explication of these manuscripts is a fine demonstration of the historian&amp;#8217;s craft, further enhanced by use of a description of the paleography courses he taught to his graduate students as a means of setting the stage.  The lesson is that it isn&amp;#8217;t just the meaning of the words that matters, but how words are recorded, and deciphering the messages encoded in the act of writing is a tricky business.  &amp;#8220;A Double Tradition&amp;#8221; is a wonderful comedy of errors involving the process of moving thoughts across languages, through alphabets (so to speak), between genres, and onto the page.  Lockhart makes it clear that deciphering all of this is important to the social history of early Spanish Mexico, but is in itself a daunting task.  In both of these articles, then, Lockhart exposes his audience to the mechanics of doing history, not as a leisurely, gentlemanly affair, but as a real&amp;nbsp;labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The Social History of Early Latin&amp;nbsp;America&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is a really lucid and really useful introduction to the foundational studies on the social history of the period under consideration.  Here, Lockhart has crafted a survey that both introduces us to the important historiography of the topic and serves as an example of how to construct an engaging historiographical article.  Interestingly, Lockhart opens with an attempt to define &amp;#8220;social history,&amp;#8221; but in the end gives up on it.  This opening may offer us the opportunity to craft our own definition of social history, which no doubt will be useful if we are going to be discussing it over the next few&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;h5 style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;VEGETATION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SCENERY&lt;/span&gt;.- &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CLIMATE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;TEMPERAMENT&lt;/span&gt;.- &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;RACE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;COLOUR&lt;/span&gt;.- &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CIVILIZATION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;BARBARISM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Prescott&amp;#8217;s epic volume &lt;a href=&#34;http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/PreConq.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;History of the Conquest of Mexico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has all sorts of things going on within its unending pages of flowery prose and alternating paeans to Mesoamerican advancements and the glories of the Spanish conquistadors who so magnificently subjugated the proud &amp;#8216;barbarians&amp;#8217; and usurped or destroyed the accomplishments of these &amp;#8216;barbarian&amp;#8217; peoples. But instead of looking at larger narrative arcs- such as the exaltation of the heroism of Cortes- I want to think through, if only heuristically, some of the motifs that appear again and again in Prescott&amp;#8217;s grand story, motifs which go a long ways, I think, towards understanding the ways in which Prescott&amp;#8217;s understanding of history operates and unfolds in his epic&amp;nbsp;tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Frederic_Edwin_Church_-_Morning_in_the_Tropics.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;452&#34; height=&#34;295&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very flowery nature of his prose underscores the sheer literal floweriness of much of his descriptive passages. They burst with colour and vibrant vegetation, as he traces the lines of the trees, naming different species and sometimes describing them in further detail; he fills out the mass of the jungle, the forest, the plains; revels in the luxuriousness of the tierra caliente. If Diaz&amp;#8217;s narrative was replete with sensory signifiers- smell, sight, taste even- Prescott zooms in on the details of the landscape in particular, drawing a striking contrast to the Spartan descriptions of Cortes. Likewise, in drafting the textual record of the landscape as a whole, Prescott engages in minute detail, carefully describing what we can recognize as ecological zones along the route of the Spaniards&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this exuberance of description no doubt conveys multiple levels of meaning and can be attributed to various influences, paramount is its role in shaping for our historian the nature of the human inhabitants of the land, themselves shaped in his understanding by the landscape, the climate, even the vegetation. The banana plant, for instance, due to its ease of cultivation and use, encourages laziness. The Spaniards, upon arriving in Cuba, become more martial and hot-blooded, literally, due to the great heat and humidity of the land. This in turn contributes to the Conquest, even if it does not entirely explain it. Perhaps the greatest juncture of geographical determinism, however, lies in Prescott&amp;#8217;s painting of the Tlaxcala, the proud and quasi-Northern European at times inhabitants of an out-and-out &amp;#8216;Republic.&amp;#8217; Having described  the alpine- and hence Northwestern-Europe like- setting of Tlaxcala, Prescott&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, although the bleak winds of the sierra gave an austerity to the climate, unlike the sunny skies and genial temperature of the lower regions, it was far more favourable to the development of both the physical and moral energies. A bold and hardy peasantry was nurtured among the recesses of the hills, fit equally to cultivate the land in peace and to defend it in war. Unlike the spoiled child of Nature, who derives such facilities of subsistence from her too prodigal hand as supersedes the necessity of exertion on his own part, the Tlascalans earned his bread- from a soil not ungrateful, it is true- by the sweat of his brow&amp;#8230; His honest bread glowed with the patriotism, or local attachment to the soil, which is the fruit of its diligent culture; while he was elevated by a proud consciousness of independence, the natural birthright of the child of the mountains. Such was the race with whom Cortes was now associated for the achievement of his great work.&amp;nbsp;(226-7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the montane world of Tlaxcala was good for republican virtues and hence made for proper allies for heroic European conquerors, the Europeans themselves were not immune from climatic&amp;nbsp;determination:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ordinances then prohibit all blasphemy against God or the saints; a vice much more frequent among Catholic than Protestant nations, arising, perhaps, less from difference of religion than physical temperament- for the warm sun of the South, under which Catholicism prevails, stimulates the sensibilities to the more violent expressions of passion.&amp;nbsp;(446)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate is not the only determining marker for Prescott. Even more consistently, skin colour emerges- not as an overt construction, laid out explicitly by Prescott, but emerging in the course of his pages- as a key factor in determining barbarity and civilization. When compared to the narratives of Cortes and Diaz, one is struck by the frequency in which the Spaniards are referred to, not just as Spaniards, Castilians, or Christians (though those terms do appear frequently), but as whites. They are white in contradistinction to the &amp;#8216;dusky&amp;#8217; colour of the &amp;#8216;natives&amp;#8217;; the starkness of the difference is most on display when the white bodies of sacrificed Spanish prisoners are on display, bright against the dark background of indigenous savagery. White is white, even if there are distinctions within European peoples (for instance, the &amp;#8216;Anglo-Saxons&amp;#8217; settle the New World for the love of liberty, unlike the somewhat lower Spaniards and their sun-enriched hot-bloodedness). For Prescott, the demarcation into white and non-white is not, probably, an especially conscious decision; it is simply a map upon which he can understand the world. This becomes all the more important as Prescott sometimes finds it difficult to keep his distinction between &amp;#8216;barbarian&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;civilized&amp;#8217; from collapsing in so much&amp;nbsp;irony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This irony continually threatens the distinctions within the book, from the very beginning, as Prescott describes the history of Mesoamerica pre-Conquest, showing the many accomplishments of the various peoples there, accomplishments which continue to appear up to the very end of the narrative. However, we are also made to know that these are not truly civilized people- rather, they are somewhere on the scale of &amp;#8216;Orientals&amp;#8217;- but only particular&amp;nbsp;Orientals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In surveying them we are strongly reminded of the civilization of the East; not of that higher, intellectual kind which belonged to the more polished Arabs and Persians, but that semi-civilization which has distinguished, for example, the Tartar races, among whom art, and even science, has made, indeed, some progress in their adaptation to material wants and sensual gratification, but little in reference to the higher and more ennobling interests of humanity.&amp;nbsp;(292)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aztecs, in particular, have many hallmarks of civilization: urban society, complex governance, a developed religion, intricate markets and a fairly advanced economy, extensive agriculture. Yet they are still barbarians; and the further into the fight the Spanish plunge the more the word &amp;#8216;barbarian&amp;#8217; resounds. Prescott does not hide the splendours of the Aztec and other civilizations; but he continually drops them down below the level of the Spanish, and stubbornly maintains this distinction, even as he cannot fully embrace the Spaniards. As he notes, their desire for conquest is driven by a decidedly archaic approach to warfare, fueled by religious zeal. Prescott several times- accurately enough, one might argue- presents the Conquest as an extension of the Crusades; for him, the religious fervor and intention of the Conquistadors is genuine enough, but evidence of a less advanced age. He cautions the reader against judging the Spaniards upon modern standards; still, the fact remains that the Spanish, Cortes even, can come across as something less than civilized, and the irony of them being the bringers of civilization to what appear to be already civilized cultures can become quite&amp;nbsp;heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;http://history.missouristate.edu/jchuchiak/aztecs40.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;230&#34; height=&#34;331&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prescott presents, as chief among his qualifiers for non-civilization, the Aztec practice of human sacrifice, and the degrading impact he argues it has upon wider culture. &amp;#8216;Superstition&amp;#8217; is the great inhibitor of civilization, and the leading indicator of barbarism. Yet- the Spanish, by Prescott&amp;#8217;s lights, have their own grave problems with superstition, and hence the appeals to not judge them. The use of religion and superstition as markers of barbarism is further problematized by Prescott&amp;#8217;s insistence (in a manner oddly reminiscent- though perhaps not genealogically connected- to the Spaniards&amp;#8217; own arguments) that Aztec religion is not intrinsic to their &amp;#8216;true selves,&amp;#8217; that it is somehow an epiphenomenon that can be detached and replaced with a more &amp;#8216;enlightened&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;progressive&amp;#8217; form of religion or philosophy. Indeed, Prescott espouses, towards the end of the story, a very explicit belief in the inevitability of progress- progress which can manifest itself anywhere, in anyone. Still- the barbarians, at least in this narrative, are always barbarians, even when the &amp;#8216;convert&amp;#8217; and becomes allies of the Spanish. And the civilized peoples- even when they are hot-blooded, throwbacks to the Middle Ages, and bound by superstitions themselves- are always civilized. Much of the narrative and analytical tension and movement in Prescott&amp;#8217;s history is devoted to the resolution of this sticky- and potentially disastrous- problem. Natives and conquerors, whites and dark-skinned: even in Prescott&amp;#8217;s story, the lines are not as clear as they should be. For one final instance: sex between whites and non-whites is nearly invisible in Prescott. Yet we are made to know that it happened, for towards the end of the narrative Prescott must mention Cortes&amp;#8217; &amp;#8216;natural son&amp;#8217; by Dona Marina, even as he does not speculate or elaborate upon the how of this progeny. The crossing between civilized and barbarian, the blending of white and dark, is there, almost- but not entirely- silent in the text, almost- not quite- swallowed in the massive sea of prose and&amp;nbsp;heroics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Prescott&amp;#8217;s epic volume &lt;a href=&#34;http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/PreConq.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;History of the Conquest of Mexico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has all sorts of things going on within its unending pages of flowery prose and alternating paeans to Mesoamerican advancements and the glories of the Spanish conquistadors who so magnificently subjugated the proud &amp;#8216;barbarians&amp;#8217; and usurped or destroyed the accomplishments of these &amp;#8216;barbarian&amp;#8217; peoples. But instead of looking at larger narrative arcs- such as the exaltation of the heroism of Cortes- I want to think through, if only heuristically, some of the motifs that appear again and again in Prescott&amp;#8217;s grand story, motifs which go a long ways, I think, towards understanding the ways in which Prescott&amp;#8217;s understanding of history operates and unfolds in his epic&amp;nbsp;tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Frederic_Edwin_Church_-_Morning_in_the_Tropics.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;452&#34; height=&#34;295&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very flowery nature of his prose underscores the sheer literal floweriness of much of his descriptive passages. They burst with colour and vibrant vegetation, as he traces the lines of the trees, naming different species and sometimes describing them in further detail; he fills out the mass of the jungle, the forest, the plains; revels in the luxuriousness of the tierra caliente. If Diaz&amp;#8217;s narrative was replete with sensory signifiers- smell, sight, taste even- Prescott zooms in on the details of the landscape in particular, drawing a striking contrast to the Spartan descriptions of Cortes. Likewise, in drafting the textual record of the landscape as a whole, Prescott engages in minute detail, carefully describing what we can recognize as ecological zones along the route of the Spaniards&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this exuberance of description no doubt conveys multiple levels of meaning and can be attributed to various influences, paramount is its role in shaping for our historian the nature of the human inhabitants of the land, themselves shaped in his understanding by the landscape, the climate, even the vegetation. The banana plant, for instance, due to its ease of cultivation and use, encourages laziness. The Spaniards, upon arriving in Cuba, become more martial and hot-blooded, literally, due to the great heat and humidity of the land. This in turn contributes to the Conquest, even if it does not entirely explain it. Perhaps the greatest juncture of geographical determinism, however, lies in Prescott&amp;#8217;s painting of the Tlaxcala, the proud and quasi-Northern European at times inhabitants of an out-and-out &amp;#8216;Republic.&amp;#8217; Having described  the alpine- and hence Northwestern-Europe like- setting of Tlaxcala, Prescott&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, although the bleak winds of the sierra gave an austerity to the climate, unlike the sunny skies and genial temperature of the lower regions, it was far more favourable to the development of both the physical and moral energies. A bold and hardy peasantry was nurtured among the recesses of the hills, fit equally to cultivate the land in peace and to defend it in war. Unlike the spoiled child of Nature, who derives such facilities of subsistence from her too prodigal hand as supersedes the necessity of exertion on his own part, the Tlascalans earned his bread- from a soil not ungrateful, it is true- by the sweat of his brow&amp;#8230; His honest bread glowed with the patriotism, or local attachment to the soil, which is the fruit of its diligent culture; while he was elevated by a proud consciousness of independence, the natural birthright of the child of the mountains. Such was the race with whom Cortes was now associated for the achievement of his great work.&amp;nbsp;(226-7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the montane world of Tlaxcala was good for republican virtues and hence made for proper allies for heroic European conquerors, the Europeans themselves were not immune from climatic&amp;nbsp;determination:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ordinances then prohibit all blasphemy against God or the saints; a vice much more frequent among Catholic than Protestant nations, arising, perhaps, less from difference of religion than physical temperament- for the warm sun of the South, under which Catholicism prevails, stimulates the sensibilities to the more violent expressions of passion.&amp;nbsp;(446)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate is not the only determining marker for Prescott. Even more consistently, skin colour emerges- not as an overt construction, laid out explicitly by Prescott, but emerging in the course of his pages- as a key factor in determining barbarity and civilization. When compared to the narratives of Cortes and Diaz, one is struck by the frequency in which the Spaniards are referred to, not just as Spaniards, Castilians, or Christians (though those terms do appear frequently), but as whites. They are white in contradistinction to the &amp;#8216;dusky&amp;#8217; colour of the &amp;#8216;natives&amp;#8217;; the starkness of the difference is most on display when the white bodies of sacrificed Spanish prisoners are on display, bright against the dark background of indigenous savagery. White is white, even if there are distinctions within European peoples (for instance, the &amp;#8216;Anglo-Saxons&amp;#8217; settle the New World for the love of liberty, unlike the somewhat lower Spaniards and their sun-enriched hot-bloodedness). For Prescott, the demarcation into white and non-white is not, probably, an especially conscious decision; it is simply a map upon which he can understand the world. This becomes all the more important as Prescott sometimes finds it difficult to keep his distinction between &amp;#8216;barbarian&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;civilized&amp;#8217; from collapsing in so much&amp;nbsp;irony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This irony continually threatens the distinctions within the book, from the very beginning, as Prescott describes the history of Mesoamerica pre-Conquest, showing the many accomplishments of the various peoples there, accomplishments which continue to appear up to the very end of the narrative. However, we are also made to know that these are not truly civilized people- rather, they are somewhere on the scale of &amp;#8216;Orientals&amp;#8217;- but only particular&amp;nbsp;Orientals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In surveying them we are strongly reminded of the civilization of the East; not of that higher, intellectual kind which belonged to the more polished Arabs and Persians, but that semi-civilization which has distinguished, for example, the Tartar races, among whom art, and even science, has made, indeed, some progress in their adaptation to material wants and sensual gratification, but little in reference to the higher and more ennobling interests of humanity.&amp;nbsp;(292)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aztecs, in particular, have many hallmarks of civilization: urban society, complex governance, a developed religion, intricate markets and a fairly advanced economy, extensive agriculture. Yet they are still barbarians; and the further into the fight the Spanish plunge the more the word &amp;#8216;barbarian&amp;#8217; resounds. Prescott does not hide the splendours of the Aztec and other civilizations; but he continually drops them down below the level of the Spanish, and stubbornly maintains this distinction, even as he cannot fully embrace the Spaniards. As he notes, their desire for conquest is driven by a decidedly archaic approach to warfare, fueled by religious zeal. Prescott several times- accurately enough, one might argue- presents the Conquest as an extension of the Crusades; for him, the religious fervor and intention of the Conquistadors is genuine enough, but evidence of a less advanced age. He cautions the reader against judging the Spaniards upon modern standards; still, the fact remains that the Spanish, Cortes even, can come across as something less than civilized, and the irony of them being the bringers of civilization to what appear to be already civilized cultures can become quite&amp;nbsp;heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;http://history.missouristate.edu/jchuchiak/aztecs40.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;230&#34; height=&#34;331&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prescott presents, as chief among his qualifiers for non-civilization, the Aztec practice of human sacrifice, and the degrading impact he argues it has upon wider culture. &amp;#8216;Superstition&amp;#8217; is the great inhibitor of civilization, and the leading indicator of barbarism. Yet- the Spanish, by Prescott&amp;#8217;s lights, have their own grave problems with superstition, and hence the appeals to not judge them. The use of religion and superstition as markers of barbarism is further problematized by Prescott&amp;#8217;s insistence (in a manner oddly reminiscent- though perhaps not genealogically connected- to the Spaniards&amp;#8217; own arguments) that Aztec religion is not intrinsic to their &amp;#8216;true selves,&amp;#8217; that it is somehow an epiphenomenon that can be detached and replaced with a more &amp;#8216;enlightened&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;progressive&amp;#8217; form of religion or philosophy. Indeed, Prescott espouses, towards the end of the story, a very explicit belief in the inevitability of progress- progress which can manifest itself anywhere, in anyone. Still- the barbarians, at least in this narrative, are always barbarians, even when the &amp;#8216;convert&amp;#8217; and becomes allies of the Spanish. And the civilized peoples- even when they are hot-blooded, throwbacks to the Middle Ages, and bound by superstitions themselves- are always civilized. Much of the narrative and analytical tension and movement in Prescott&amp;#8217;s history is devoted to the resolution of this sticky- and potentially disastrous- problem. Natives and conquerors, whites and dark-skinned: even in Prescott&amp;#8217;s story, the lines are not as clear as they should be. For one final instance: sex between whites and non-whites is nearly invisible in Prescott. Yet we are made to know that it happened, for towards the end of the narrative Prescott must mention Cortes&amp;#8217; &amp;#8216;natural son&amp;#8217; by Dona Marina, even as he does not speculate or elaborate upon the how of this progeny. The crossing between civilized and barbarian, the blending of white and dark, is there, almost- but not entirely- silent in the text, almost- not quite- swallowed in the massive sea of prose and&amp;nbsp;heroics.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;William H. Prescott’s work is, at a very basic level, “big man” history at its finest.  In this regard both Montezuma and Cortes are the works two chief protagonists.  For Prescott, both epitomize their respective civilizations.  Perhaps the exchange between the two in Tenochtitlan wherein Montezuma comments on their joint lack of divinity best summarizes Prescott’s take on the character of an individual who dramatically shapes history. Though both are mortal, flesh and blood, for Prescott both exceeded their worldly limitations: thus the digressions on each individual’s character.   Aside from these two, who are by turns tragic, heroic, or even both, there are foils for both and the mass of their&amp;nbsp;followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I envision the mechanism of history for Prescott as two massive pyramids with both protagonists at their pinnacle, tapering into the mists of the past as one get further and further from the top.  Other figures are visible, especially in Cortes’s camp, but the tragically wrong Spanish civilization, perhaps blessed by vestigial traces of &lt;em&gt;romanitas, &lt;/em&gt;must collide with the enticingly noble but benighted, sanguine heathen of Mexico.   For Prescott the outcome is never in question, except where dramatic device demands&amp;nbsp;anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this narrative it would be fairly easy to outline Prescott’s goals and his craft.  The man is obviously an utter master of language.  The potency of his ability makes the story intrinsically appealing.  The reader feels in the company of the great narrators of the classical past: Pliny, Suetonius, Caesar, and Plutarch.  Prescott’s flowering verbosity and his eye for detail weave a spell in a literal sense.   The question that I must ask myself after all this has wilted is a difficult one: What can I learn from Prescott?  For many even today this type of work would be considered the pinnacle of historical writing.  An engaging narrative is often sought by a popular audience.  One that appeals to an ideology of self-reliance and perseverance in the face of barbaric and indomitable odds is doubly so.  Yet Prescott’s work doesn’t seem so cut and dry to me.  What of the Tlascalans?    Are they ennobled by Cortes, or do they lend a needed ferocity to the more (albeit not entirely) civilized Spaniards?  I think in these places, where there is a blurring or shift in his treatment of psychological drive, the essential nature of his protagonist(s), a greater understanding of the man and his times can be found.  Is the ultimate end of a discussion of his history an understanding of Prescott and his times?  Not entirely, but it’s a beginning.

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;At first, I must say I found little to dislike or criticize regarding William H. Prescott&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;History of the Conquest of Mexico&lt;/em&gt;. This classic (formerly seminal?) work, after all, was published well over a century and a half ago. The conditions in which Prescott worked (lengthy transatlantic crossings, laboriously copying manuscripts by hand, failing eyesight) give the resulting volume an impressiveness on par with Gibbon&amp;#8217;s accomplishment of seventy years earlier. In addition, much of Prescott&amp;#8217;s introductory remarks struck me as decidedly modern and, in keeping with my view of historians as some of the most generous people on earth, highly professional. The author gives credit where it is due, and gratitude to the librarians, archivists, and correspondents who have assisted him with the work. Already, Prescott came across well in my mind&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the &lt;em&gt;History&lt;/em&gt; is far from being a panegyric about the exploits of Cortes and the Spaniards, as I initially feared it would be. I was impressed, and surprised, at the attention given to the ancient Mexica, and the respect accorded their magnificent civilization. No doubt much of this is my own sense of presentism&amp;#8211;no scholar of the nineteenth century could shed favorable light on the non-European conquered peoples, I perhaps assumed. Yet Prescott seeks to &amp;#8220;acquaint the reader with the character of this extraordinary race,&amp;#8221; and initially does so admirably (p. ix). The descriptions of Tenochitlan as th Venice of the New World, the appreciation of the engineering skills of the Mexica, and his open admiration of their horticultural abilities in that harsh climate was, for me,&amp;nbsp;refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read, however, I began to do so more critically. Prescott indeed expressed some admiration for the ancient Mexicans, but by no means does he examine them on theitr own merits, as I initially assumed.  Much of Chapter 3 , for example, discusses the religions and rites of the Mexica, and I could not help but notice an implicit anti-clerical strain: &amp;#8220;The influence of the priesthood must be greatest in an imperfect state of civilization, where it engrosses all the scanty science in its own body&amp;#8221; (p. 55).  Just as I began to wonder whether Prescott was not expressing much of the anti-Catholicism of the educated American classes of the nineteenth century, the author makes a more explicit reference: &amp;#8220;The secrets of the [Aztec] confessional were held inviolable, and penances were imposed of much the same kind as those enjoined by the Roman Catholic Church&amp;#8221; (56). Prescott, like all historians everywhere, write from the perspective of the times in which they live.  On the other hand, Prescott&amp;#8217;s admiration of Cortes (quite obviously Catholic) and Queen Isabella (ditto) are unmistakable, so this might be reading too much into the&amp;nbsp;material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Prescott admires Cortes, however&amp;#8211;as opposed to merely being intrigued or fascinated by him&amp;#8211;is unmistakable. The great Captain&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;enlightened genius&amp;#8221; shines on nearly every page (xi). This lead, for me, to the most important realization concerning Prescott&amp;#8217;s fine, but imperfect, work.  (Much of the primary sources he accepts uncritically, particularly Bernal Diaz del Castillo.) Prescott&amp;#8217;s narrative is largely a celebration of Cortes and his men, and the trials they endured as they marched toward the Valley of Mexico.  That is to say, the author writes with an agenda. Every scholar does, granted, but as I read it occured to me that Prescott never considered the Conquest as anything other than a major step in the march of progress.  Although he admired the Mexica on certain, primarily technical, grounds, at no point in the text does he suggest that they deserved to maintain their way of life. Perhaps, of course, it is not the histrians responsibility to do that&amp;#8211;to play &amp;#8220;what if&amp;#8221; games. If  it is the historian&amp;#8217;s task, however, to explain how and why things happen, Prescott&amp;#8217;s work, for all its attributes, deserves to be remembred as the product of a bygone&amp;nbsp;era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wit, concerning the Aztec women: &amp;#8220;They appear to have&amp;#8230;passed thir time in indolent tranquility, or in such feminine occupations as spinning, embroidery and the like[.]&amp;#8220;  Yet perhaps I am being unduly harsh on Prescott; he was a product of his own time, as am I.  Suffice it to say, both the histories of Mexico and Peru (which, frankly, I prefer for a variety of reasons) are inarguably page-turners. If nothing else, Prescott is a master of the narrative&amp;nbsp;form.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;William Prescott&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;History of the Conquest of Mexico &lt;/em&gt;is a tale of bravado and chivalry worthy of standing alongside stories of King Arthur and the Homeric Epics. He portrays Cortes and his intrepid band of men as fearless adventurers who came to civilize Mexico in the name of God and country. Whereas Cortes comes across as a manipulator at best in other narratives, Prescott portrays him as a military genius fighting a holy war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prescott buys into the myths presented in the handful of texts he examines as his sources, the firsthand accounts of the conquistadors and the subsequent Spanish histories written in their wake. The conquistadors are mighty men who tame a vast nation with little outside help. Their motives, if not pure, are at least well-intentioned. In fact, the only myth that Prescott doesn&amp;#8217;t perpetuate is that the conquest was made possible by the will of God. The conquistadors were far too talented for that assessment. As something of an apologist, he claims that we must understand and judge Cortes and his men on their terms, not ours. And by their standards, they were doing the Native Americans a favor by conquering them and bringing them to Christ and king. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging Prescott by his own terms, he probably wrote the best history of the conquest possible in his era. He used all the sources available, or at least all the available sources considered worth examining. While all he did was consolidate a handful of texts, that was the expectation of a historian of his era. And his writing is brilliant. Indeed, it is his strength, though without his colorful and charming language the book might be half its size. Still, his writing is better than all but the best of narratives of any kind. Its strength is its vivaciousness. He makes the characters come alive, their deeds seem as if they are performed before you, and the landscape as if it is painted on the inside of your eyelids and you can travel there if you close them. If he had published his gripping tale in this era, Hollywood would be clamoring for the movie rights. Indeed, he tells his tale so well, I almost believed it.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-8416887078677296921?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Well I am just going to say it up front and get it out of my system.  What is wrong with 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century historians?  These men were scholars they should have known better but no they are the raciest people.  And I’m not singling out the historians, anthropology was just as bad and the damage they did to other cultures we are still trying to recover from it all.  The tone Prescott takes concerning native populations especially North American tribes is dripping with distain and arrogance and it drives me nuts.  If you are a scholar you should be trying to understand other cultures not perpetuate ideas of superiority that were developed when the conquest began.  So I’ve said my peace and we can move&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Prescott’s &lt;em&gt;History of the Conquest of Mexico &lt;/em&gt;is an extremely detailed account of the Spanish influence in Mexico.  This work is more in the vein of Dias’ account as multiple primary sources were available to piece together the events which occurred.  However, the problem with basing your work on primary documents means you get the original Spanish propaganda as well.  All throughout the book the tone is almost identical to the accounts of the conquistadors, praising the Spanish and bring civilization to the natives in the name of God.  The myths of the Spanish are self perpetuated throughout Prescott’s work casing the reader to doubt the validity of the truth of the&amp;nbsp;facts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the book I found perplexing was how Prescott compared things.  When the Spanish first beheld the sites in Mexico it became necessary to describe to the crown what they were seeing.  Buy how do you do so?  Through comparison.  However, Prescott takes it to another level.  Due to the complexity of the civilization Prescott could not simply designate them as savages so in turn he turns to comparing them to ancient civilizations for a majority of the time.  Even doing to he is placing their civilization as far away temporally as possible to his own&amp;nbsp;culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its many faults Prescott’s work is a prime example of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century attitude towards history.  As first hand research was scarce primary document use was the norm.  Which in turn perpetuated the superiority complex of European scholars.  As a product of this we get &lt;em&gt;History of the Conquest of Mexico &lt;/em&gt;which is easier to read than Cortes’ account as it is meant to be scholarly work.  I often found it hard to follow Cortes’ account as it wasn’t meant for a wide audience.  Prescott’s work attempts to synthesize the history in a more organized manner.  This was at least one aspect I liked about the book.  And one does have to keep in mind the time in which it was written.  So in truth the book serves two purposes.  First it examines the actual history of the conquest and secondly it provided an almost anthropological look at the mentality of 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century scholarly work and how they viewed other cultures in relation to&amp;nbsp;themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;William H. Prescott&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;History of the Conquest of Mexico&lt;/em&gt; reminded me of so many other nineteenth-century documents written by historians, missionaries, and others, regarding Native American populations and the approach of &amp;#8220;civilization.&amp;#8221;  Positing the civilization versus savagery as a central theme of his history, Prescott represented well the period of his writing and the views of Indian peoples held by him and his contemporaries.  Of course, the advance of civilization came at a price for those not willing to break from their savagery &amp;#8211; in this case, the &amp;#8220;Aztecs&amp;#8221; and others found themselves directly in the path of a distinct Roman Catholic civilization, represented by Cortes and his fellow soldiers for the Faith.  Prescott justified their conquest of Mexico on the grounds that the &amp;#8220;Aztecs&amp;#8221; proved unwilling to advance the cause of humanity, i.e. the advance of civilization, thus their conquest constituted a good shaped by divine providence and enacted by&amp;nbsp;Cortes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prescott also fell prey to many of the myth cited by Restall in our earlier reading.  Using terms such as &amp;#8220;soldiers,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;infantry,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;troops,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;cavalry&amp;#8221; to describe Cortes and his group of conquistadors, Prescott gave the impression that these men were trained military fighters rather than a group of regular men looking to acquire land, wealth, and position in the &amp;#8220;New World.&amp;#8221;  Prescott further advanced the myth of a small group of Spaniards conquering large numbers of Aztecs and other Native American groups.  While the author did acknowledge at one point in his text that Indians actually conquered Indians during the Conquest, Prescott constantly questioned Cortes&amp;#8217;s account of the number of Native Americans allied with&amp;nbsp;Cortes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the Christian soldiers conquered the Aztecs, and per Prescott, that was precisely the way things were supposed to work&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;James Lockhart wrote, “We must admire Prescott as an initiator, a supremely able person with narrative synthesis, a person of large vision and historiographical sensitivities.  But in many ways he belongs to his time; he is by present standards extremely naïve, and he purveys some of the most pernicious, undying clichés known to the field … but if readers can learn to ignore or mentally translate a series of stereotypes, there is nowhere they can get as good a narrative of the main events, crises, and course of the Mexican conquest” (xxv).  In a sense, this is what I tried, albeit much more clumsily, to convey with my photo essay—the Victorian drawing room as the reference point for Prescott’s worldview and mentalité, and the myths that he reproduces in crafting his narrative.  And underneath the sweeping narrative conventions lies historical truth, like the Aztec ruins beneath so many foundations in Mexico&amp;nbsp;City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciated Lockhart’s suggestion to first read Prescott as one might read James Fenimore Cooper—for as such, he succeeds.  Then one can look past the mythic portrayal of Cortés, read Prescott’s often beautiful prose, and glean from his magisterial synthesis of the Conquest documents. Prescott is a romantic historian, a philosophic historian, and a damn good novelist—he tells a moving story.  Also, he is clearly a genius to be able to compose such an epic without the use of his&amp;nbsp;sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It is important to remember that as a nineteenth-century American, Prescott understands the Aztecs on his own terms.  He talks of Aztec feudalism—lords and vassals—and understands Aztec law in terms of property rights, compares Aztec marriage to Christian&amp;nbsp;marriage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influence of antiquarianism and midcentury ideals is quite clear; ever present is the nineteenth-century dualism of “civilization” versus “savagery.”  Prescott’s simultaneously condescending and romantic view of indigenous Americans and their civilization is characteristic of his era, and Prescott’s position is clear.  He writes: “It was beneficently ordered by Providence that the land should be delivered over to another race, who would rescue it from the brutish superstitions that daily extended wider and wider, with extent of empire”&amp;nbsp;(69).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an historian of nineteenth-century America, I find it interesting how much Prescott’s narrative illuminates the ideas and prejudices of his own time and&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;

            <id>/history561/posts/ready-to-carry-the-conquering-eagles-to-another-world.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I was thoroughly prepared to hate Prescott.  I assumed that it was going to be another mundane example of the kind of nineteenth-century drivel that drove Charlotte Perkins Gilman into madness.  I was quite wrong.  Simply put, Prescott’s &lt;em&gt;History of the Conquest of Mexico&lt;/em&gt; is awesome.  Two scoops of awesome, in&amp;nbsp;fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not awesome as a work of historical inquiry, but rather, as a work of storytelling.  Prescott masterfully crafts his narrative as a battle of wits between two powerful men, Cortes and Montezuma.  The figures receive strong character development – Cortes is a “youthful cavalier” (171) and Montezuma displays “energy and enterprise” (222) – as each marches fatuously to confront the&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prescott’s word-smithing, too, is brilliant and enviable.  Sentences such as “the golden visions of security and repose, in which he had so long indulged, the lordly sway descended from his ancestors, his broad imperial domain, were all to pass away” (384) inspire one to greatness (or elicit remorse that there are no more worlds to conquer).  But Prescott is also able to be playful with his language, frequently indulging in fascinating feats of alliteration, such as “it was fortunate for Cortes that Olmedo was not one of those frantic friars, who would have fanned his fiery temper …”&amp;nbsp;(290).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most endearing quality of &lt;em&gt;History of the Conquest of Mexico&lt;/em&gt; is its classicizing nature.  It is clear that Prescott received a classical education, and even that he might have an unhealthy addiction to things Roman (if such a thing is possible).  &lt;em&gt;History of the Conquest of Mexico&lt;/em&gt; reads like a mixture of Caesar’s &lt;em&gt;De Bello Gallico&lt;/em&gt; and Lucan’s &lt;em&gt;Pharsalia&lt;/em&gt;.  Indeed, one might even posit that Prescott consciously intended to portray Cortes as a sixteenth-century Caesar, and Montezuma as a blend of Pompey and Vercingetorix (more of the latter, clearly).  Prescott opens with a line from Lucan describing Caesar as he prepared for battle, and, taken out of context, it appears apt for Cortes’s venture.  Elsewhere, Prescott engages in allusions to Caesar, describing the siege of Tenochtitlan in the manner that Caesar described the siege of Alesia, putting into the mouth of Cortes the orders of Lucan’s Caesar (207), and indeed modeling the opening description of Mexico on Caesar’s own description of&amp;nbsp;Gaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bravo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoc opus, hic labor est, primo sine munere&amp;nbsp;iungi.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The structure of Cortes’s letters to Charles V seems to fall into three categories: things he sees, things he does, and things he asks.  Although all three of these categories are often in action at any given time, the emphasis on one or the other at any particular time give some insight into the mind of Cortes.  The broad outline of all the second third and fifth letters (the first and the fourth ones I will treat separately) looks like this: introduction, relation of actions/ spoils (things or people), and finally a heartfelt plea to the Crown for help, redress, or to simply hear his side of the story. This is not to simplify the documents, again all three themes interplay with each other and each relies on the integrity of the whole text.   As an example of my template I would draw your attention to the second letter.  Its initial pages are colored by the descriptions of beautiful cities, aquaducts, markets and natural wonders.  However, by the end of the letter Cortes has switched gears to his dealings with Montezuma.  His description of the beauty of Tenochtitlan takes a back seat to his political machinations.   In the Third letter there is a similar pattern though with little if any description of things.  Martial valor and a keen mind take precedence here.  Cortes focuses on his accomplishments and the action of the battle, but again at the end of the letter he begins to delve into political&amp;nbsp;intrigue.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth letter seems to me to be the most like an epistle.  What do I mean by this?  There is little narration and more direct communication with the audience, the Crown. The titles Cortes honors his king with are more elaborate here and more often cited.  Legalistic issues with ruling and defending his role in New Spain take on more of a prominent role as opposed to the glories of the Third Letter.  Perhaps this is simply reflective of his desire to help maintain the status quo and his overtures to Rome, which were not present earlier would argue for&amp;nbsp;this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the fifth letter fits better in the first category I have withheld its discussion to the end because it seems an amalgamation of the two forms discussed above.  Yes there is more of a direct conversation, especially at the end and a somewhat increased pattern of references to the Church, but he also laps into description of terrain and villages.  He even goes so far as to write about “beautiful virgins” (363).  Perhaps he was&amp;nbsp;lonely?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/scarrige.wordpress.com/11/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/scarrige.wordpress.com/11/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/scarrige.wordpress.com/11/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/scarrige.wordpress.com/11/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/scarrige.wordpress.com/11/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/scarrige.wordpress.com/11/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/scarrige.wordpress.com/11/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/scarrige.wordpress.com/11/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/scarrige.wordpress.com/11/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/scarrige.wordpress.com/11/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=scarrige.wordpress.com&amp;blog=11510192&amp;post=11&amp;subd=scarrige&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;http://www.lilalions.com/blog/CM1A_LF/images/cortes=jeanne.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;239&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig. 1: The Man Himself, All By&amp;nbsp;Himself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Expanding and Contracting Pronoun&lt;/em&gt;: These are not merely letters; these are public performances, self-conscious public performances. The conquest, re-enacted, re-staged, re-written (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOR0zLL7UlU&#34;&gt;eventually re-sung,&lt;/a&gt; though one wonders what Cortes would think). At their center (except when the focus must shift, as we shall see) is Cortes, the writer, the hero, the Conquistador par excellence. All that happens here, from his shifty flight from Cuba to his armed excursions across Mesoamerica, to his pleading for fundage from his Majesty, are the actions of Cortes, are focused on Cortes, and, of course, are written down by Cortes. Here we see him performing before the Crown, before the eyes of the public (at least, the public that might get a hold of this record), not just asking for reimbursement, but asking for something grander and more long-lasting, eternal even: recognition, fame, remembrance. And not just any remembrance, not just any fame- his memory must be in the form he desires, in which he is the motive power of the great Conquest, the man who single-handedly set up New Spain, and perhaps, Old Spain as well, himself bestowing Empire upon his Emperor. But more on the business of New Spain below. The point here is that all of this flows from the hand of&amp;nbsp;Cortes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, almost everything. The initial phase of the Conquest- the embarking from Cuba, the setting of up of Vera Cruz, the initial campaigns- Cortes describes through the imperious, all-embracing &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;. Here and there other wills, other actors, are allowed to intrude- his companions, for instance, wanted him to lead them, to free them from the stupidity and tyranny of Velasquez. But otherwise, Cortes leads, fights, scouts, builds, all of it. Occasionally &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; appears, but fleetingly. Cortes does it all, and we marvel. Hellofaguy. Of indigenous allies we hear little to nothing; of Dona Marina, so prominent in Diaz&amp;#8217;s narrative, there is a brief mention by name in two places, and a few guessed mentions under the title of &amp;#8216;translators,&amp;#8217; in the plural, appendages to Cortes&amp;#8217; speech, and nothing more really; her origins are not even brought up until well into the Fifth Letter, and then only briefly. Cortes absorbs Spaniard and indigenous, all fading into his looming pronoun. On an even higher level, Cortes assumes the role of the Monarch himself, most pointedly in his repeated magnanimous bestowal of forgiveness upon repentant towns, in the name of the Sovereign. But he does not stop here- at times Cortes appears to be channeling God Himself, as he suggests that his tactical brilliance was in fact divinely inspired. The lines between Cortes and royal authority- and even divine knowledge and right- become blurry. The great and glorious&lt;em&gt; I &lt;/em&gt;expansive,&amp;nbsp;indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Cortes, as attached as he is to his presence and agency in the text, knows when to draw back- or perhaps, must draw back at times. When things go wrong, he is careful to disentangle himself from events as much as he can. He knew that Spanish strategy- or lack thereof- would go wrong at times during the siege of Tenochtitlan; in the end he triumphed, but there were lots of other actors and wills tangling things up. The presence of allied peoples became inescapable further and further into the war; one gets the feel that Cortes must bow to the overwhelming scope of things. He is unable to occlude what is terribly obvious to him and would likely continue to be terribly obvious in any text, coming straight from la Noche Triste to overwhelming triumph. Something had to be different, and even Cortes cannot avoid it. He seeks to maintain control of the narrative- describing one particular Tlaxcala triumph as only having come alongside Spanish assistance. Yet at some points he must admit outright the balance of things- there are nine hundred Spaniards, he tells us, and one hundred and fifty thousand indigenous allies. Yet even once the Tlaxcala and others appear, they tend, more so here than in Diaz&amp;#8217;s account, to melt into one mass of &amp;#8216;Indians,&amp;#8217; a few with names, but fewer than with Diaz. If the many must appear against Cortes&amp;#8217; one, they are as monolithic as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Fifth Letter, we see a somewhat more nuanced Cortes, as there is, one might imagine, somewhat less glory and importance attached to this expedition, the jungle shading things over and obscuring the magnificence of conquering the Mexica capital. Yet Cortes remains in control, and at times his self-image is inflated back to its true heights. He is terribly proud of his bridge, a bridge he built when his compatriots failed him. Yet here he must (I think must is the right word, but perhaps there is some further change going on here?) admit- if it had not been for the chieftans and their followers, no bridge, despite the sheer excellence of Cortes&amp;#8217; plan. Even heroes, it turns out, cannot stand completely alone, even in their own&amp;nbsp;texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Cortez_&amp;amp;_La_Malinche.jpg/400px-Cortez_&amp;amp;_La_Malinche.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fig. 2: Cortes and Some&amp;nbsp;Others&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Redrawing the Map&lt;/em&gt;: This is a world full of written documents, of writing over things, both on paper and otherwise. From the notary reading off his required bit (perhaps in translation, perhaps not) at the start of battle to the final (or is it?) act of Cortes putting it all on paper, for History, the world of the Americas is being re-inscribed. Its geography does not escape. As Cortes views again the &amp;#8216;New World&amp;#8217; through his text, it becomes old. Granada is discovered again, its inhabitants wearing- just like Muslims!- burnooses, slightly different. Like the Muslim kingdom so recently defeated, Tlaxcala is mountainous, independent, and, presumably, far better off absorbed by the (Re)conquest. If it escapes renaming, that is only because even Cortes shrinks from some tasks he deems to enormous. Other towns and rivers are re-branded, recast as familiar places, the Spaniards not content to simply lay their old geography over the land inside their own heads. Names are followed by more vivid, more long-lasting geographical intrusions, as crosses go up, towns are founded and fortresses erected: the slow, granted, marking of the landscape itself with the traces, ever more and more enduring, of the Spanish presence, of Spanish-Castillian, really-&amp;nbsp;land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;The whole land- much of it simply imagined (perhaps there is a Northwest Passage at one end?)- is named by Cortes: New Spain. Not, importantly, New Castille, but New Spain. Long before the whole can be united, before there is even real full union in Old Spain, Cortes has formed with the flourish of his pen a new entity, an all-embracing (like his imperious, pan-optic, pan-active &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;) place, a place that does not (yet- ever?) exist, that lies over every geographical and otherwise reality beneath it, and which- so Cortes hopes- will remark every place it embraces. Within its boundaries, now, acts of indigenous resistance become rebellions; conquest is not conquest, really, but merely imposition of the Spanish Monarch&amp;#8217;s rightful authority. Function follows form. The name is summoned before the fact, and the fact must&amp;nbsp;arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;http://z.about.com/d/baltimore/1/0/V/5/-/-/WaltersMapsCortes500x319.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;319&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Letters from Mexico,&lt;/em&gt; by Hernán&amp;nbsp;Cortés&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a popular song from about five years ago that goes, “Hate is a strong word, but I really, really, really don’t like you.”  Well, hate is a strong word, but I really, really, really don’t like Hernán Cortés.  In fact, I think Bartolomé de las Casas summed up Cortes with one simple description: “that oppressor of&amp;nbsp;men.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after reading Cortés’ letters, I &lt;em&gt;am &lt;/em&gt;willing to give the devil his due.  Not a great man—Matthew Restall was once again correct—but Cortés certainly was a master manipulator.  A manipulator of people, and a manipulator of&amp;nbsp;law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very beginning of his second letter to Charles V of Spain, written in early 1519, Cortés says that Mexico is a “kingdom with no less glory than of Germany” (which Charles the V had recently come to rule as Holy Roman Emperor) (48). Basically Cortés is presenting Mexico as yet another jewel in the crown of Charles V.  As to Moctezuma, Cortés “assured Your Highness that I would take him alive in chains or make him subject to Your Majesty’s Royal Crown” (50).  Cortés always, always flatters the emperor.  Which, of course, is mere ritual language, reflecting how anyone should address the sovereign.  But Cortés goes beyond the cultural scripts—he somehow manages to finagle his renegade activities into becoming governor of New&amp;nbsp;Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold provides an excellent example of Cortés’ skill as a “spin doctor.”  In the beginning of the first letter, Cortés describes Diego Velázquez as “moved more by cupidity than any other passion” because Velázquez was excited by rumors of gold (5).  But when Cortés describes his own assimilation of Moctezuma’s treasure, it is different.  “I asked him to give me something of what he possessed, for I wished to send it to your majesty … When all was melted down that could be, Your Majesty’s fifth came to more than 32,400 &lt;em&gt;pesos de oro&lt;/em&gt;, exclusive of the gold and silver jewelry, and the featherwork and precious stones and many other valuable things which I designated for Your Holy Majesty.  All these … are so marvelous that considering their novelty and strangeness they are priceless; nor can it be believed that any of the princes of this world, of whom we know, possess any things of such high quality?” (100).  Others are possessed by cupidity, but Cortés is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thinking of the resplendence of His Majesty’s coffers—and offering to fill them with a treasure like none&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortés also presents all of his actions as being perfectly justified, perfectly legal.  For example, in the second letter, he defends attacking the people of Tepeaca.  “I will say that only after we had made our demands for peace on Your Majesty’s behalf and they had not complied, we made war on them and they fought many times with us.  With God’s help and the Royal fortune of Your Majesty we always routed them and killed many, without their killing or wounding a single Spaniard” (146).  Cortés’ actions are always just and divinely sanctioned, it seems…  But other Spaniards, like Diego Velazquez, may be wicked.  In the third letter Cortés supposedly uncovers a plot to kill him by Velazquez and an Indian &lt;em&gt;cacique&lt;/em&gt;.  Cortés paints himself thus:  “Velazquez’s men have since set me many traps and secretly caused many disturbances and quarrels against which I have found I have to be more on my guard than against the enemy.  Our Lord God, however, has always guided us in such a manner that without punishing those men there is complete peace and tranquility; but if I hear of anything further I will punish them as justice demands” (278).  Oh, the &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;longsuffering&lt;/em&gt; conquistador…  It’s disgusting,&amp;nbsp;really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving past all that, once again, I see the difficulty of communicating through interpreters and in unfamiliar cultures, as Matthew Restall highlights in &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths&lt;/em&gt;.  But where Díaz gives a touching portrait of Malintzín’s early life, being given from person to person to Cortes, Cortés downplays interpreters to the point where Malintzín is hardly described at all. He writes:  “During the three days I remained in the city they fed us worse each day, and the lords and principal persons of the city came only rarely to see and speak with me.  And being somewhat disturbed by this, &lt;strong&gt;my interpreter, who is an Indian woman from Putunchan&lt;/strong&gt; … was told by another Indian woman and a native of this city that very close by many of Mutezuma’s men were gathered, and that the people of the city had sent away their women and that if she wished to escape she should go with her and she would shelter here” [emphasis added]&amp;nbsp;(73).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, however, reading Cortés gave me a whole new appreciation for Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who is, comparatively, the epitome of&amp;nbsp;objectivity!&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Cortes&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Letters from Mexico &lt;/em&gt;constitutes a time-consuming but somewhat entertaining read concerning the aforementioned conquistador&amp;#8217;s take on the Conquest.  Filled with stories and episodes designed to cast Cortes in a most favorable light while casting the Cuban governor and others in a most unfavorable one, Cortes&amp;#8217;s letters apparently achieved exactly their intention, gaining him the governorship of Mexico.  Ironically, by unequivocally casting himself as Charles V&amp;#8217;s servant, Cortes eventually lost the position he fought so valiantly for (both physically and&amp;nbsp;politically).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortes&amp;#8217;s letters fit the self-serving genre both the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;J.H.&lt;/span&gt; Elliot and Anthony Padgen place them in, and once again, Restall&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths&lt;/em&gt; shed further light on the selfish and greedy spirit of these documents.  Cortes continually embellishes and champions his role in the Conquest while downplaying or besmirching the parts played by both his comrades and his enemies.  The governor of Cuba becomes a greedy, self-serving betrayer of Charles V while Cortes portrays himself as the King&amp;#8217;s champion and the missionary-saint of the Catholic faith.  Even Dona Marina garners little attention despite her central historical role in the success of the conquest.   Of course, besides being private correspondence between Cortes and Charles V, these letters became  public documents upon their publication &amp;#8211; a purposeful intention from their inception.  What better way to guarantee official acquiescence to one&amp;#8217;s desires than to generate massive public support for one&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;claims?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Cortes&amp;#8217;s most obvious attempt at casting events to legitimize his claim of conquest on behalf of Charles V and the Roman Catholic Church occurs in Montezuma&amp;#8217;s alleged speech detailing how the Mexica chieftain had only been holding  his empire anticipating the arrival of a group of men from the east to whom the country actually belonged.  By Montezuma allegedly swearing allegiance to Charles V and granting Cortes whatever he wants, later conflicts become rebellions necessitating&amp;nbsp;conquest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Cortes strikes one as the consummate politician or FoxNews broadcaster, casting events in such a way as to portray either the office-holder or the preferred political party in the best possible&amp;nbsp;light.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;The collected letters of Hernan Cortez addressed to Charles V came off as somewhat unremarkable.  Not to say that I was disappointed by his pleas and accounting, but that excitement was probably the last thing from the mind of Cortez doesn’t help his story telling. Bernal Diaz’s relation of his “adventures” while in the far-flung lands of the New World was much more exciting and engaging, but Diaz also had quite a bit more time to revise and create his story.  I expected to read about the horrible tribulations endured by the stalwart captain and his stalwart advocacy of Christ and Crown, along with the similarities between parts of Europe and places he saw.  In this regard though bored, I was not disappointed.  Perhaps the most titillating aspect of these letters is in fact who isn’t present.  Dona Marina, who played such a pivotal role in Diaz’s narrative, is nearly absent.  Local allies are presented in a similar way to that of Diaz, except when someone who Cortez particularly likes stands out.  A certain indigenous youth was almost afforded a paean by the good captain. Other “stand-out” parts of the letters were the sections wherein Cortez relates the pains to which he went to build upon the land or water. Diaz did not seem as concerned with Cortez with building, though this may be a function of Cortez’s role as a leader.   The environment and his attempts to control/ civilize it make the forests, swamps, and lakes as much a threat as his human&amp;nbsp;enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an endnote, the endnotes/ explanatory notes were by far the most entertaining section of the book…especially the note explaining the myth of the supposed “apotheosis” of Cortez et al.  I suppose that after you spend a good deal of time studying and translating these letters, you have to develop a good sense of humor to stay&amp;nbsp;sane.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Hernan Cortes’ &lt;em&gt;Letters from Mexico&lt;/em&gt; is a compilation of five letters sent to the king of Spain, Charles V during the conquest of Mexico.  My first impressions of the book were not good ones.  When we were reading Dias there was more of a tone of truth in how it was told.  But in Cortes’ letters it is evident of how politics played a part in the conquest.  Page after page is filled with entries about who did what wrong and how Cortes was trying to correct the problem for the greater glory of the king.  With this tone it’s hard to accept it as a good primary document, who knows what was omitted to show Cortes in a good&amp;nbsp;light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the legitimacy of the factual evidence is a little fuzzy in my mind the letters are a good marker for the time.  We have talked a lot about the “myths of the conquest” and this book has it in spades.  As you are reading it you can truly see how the Spanish regarded themselves to not only the natives but other Spaniards as well.  And in the end can you really blame Cortes he may be arrogant but every other conquistador searching for fortune was as well.  If you wanted to make a fortune in the new world then you had to make sure the king thought you were the best man for the job.  And that meant pointing fingers at every possible person.  So I may not like it, but that is how it was.  It was ingrained into the conquistadors to act this way forming their own form of social&amp;nbsp;norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one part of the book that I did really like, the notes.  The notes for this translation were great.  They were informative and filled in gaps were you desperately needed an explanation.  When reading these time period letters it is often hard to either follow the writer’s train of thought or understand fully what is going on based on their brief explanations.  The notes provided for Cortes’ letters would more fully explain the circumstances which occurred and the history surrounding the assumptions made by the&amp;nbsp;Cortes.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Hernan Cortes’ &lt;em&gt;Letters from Mexico &lt;/em&gt;is the text of five letters written to Charles V of Spain. Cortes wrote them to state his case before Charles, as he did not have a straightforward claim to the right to settle and govern in Mexico. With excessive flattery, Cortes states that he has only Charles’ interests in mind, as he conquered Mexico only to bring glory and wealth to Charles and further his reputation as a Christian monarch by winning the souls of the Native Americans to Catholicism. Furthermore, Diego Velazquez, the Governor of Cuba who initially sent Cortes to Mexico, was a usurper not to be trusted by Charles, as he had only his selfish interests in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, &lt;em&gt;Letters from Mexico &lt;/em&gt;is an interesting firsthand account of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. With its extensive length, it does seem repetitive after several hundred pages of weary battles and flowery justification for his presence in Mexico in service or a worthy monarch. Several glaring omissions make the book less useful then, for example, Bernal Diaz Del Castillo’s &lt;em&gt;The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico&lt;/em&gt;. The most glaring omission is that of Dona Marina, mentioned only in passing a handful of times yet crucial to other accounts of the conquest. This makes Cortes only seem more self-serving, as if he was still more solely responsible for the works accomplished in the name of Charles V. Granted, the letters were written to paint Cortes in the best colors possible. Cortes not only wanted to look worthy before a monarch, but also before a general audience that included generations to come, if the end of the fifth letter is to be believed. To that goal, Cortes’ letters were successful as his name is more synonymous with the conquest than any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the introduction, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;J.H.&lt;/span&gt; Elliot states that “Motecucoma was the least dangerous of the enemies who Cortes had to face, and that he had more to fear from some of his own countrymen than from the emperor of the Mexica.” To be fair, Cortes’ military prowess was the least of his assets which helped him secure his place in history. Indeed, his Machiavellian presentation of himself in comparison to his rivals seems the most crucial to his success. If Cortes is to be believed, he is a tireless crusader for Charles V, willing to risk life and limb for the abstract ideal of winning glory for his worthy and nearly faultless leader. Perhaps to this end, he frequently portrays the Native Americans in contrast with the Moors, a political and religious adversary the Spanish knew well. Furthermore, Cortes also portrays himself as a missionary, undertaking his feats as much to bring wealth to Charles V as to win converts in his name. Cortes even takes something of a vow of poverty, willing to assume debts that may or not be repaid by future gains in the name of his mission. Cortes is certainly not the selfless crusader he presents himself to be. Any admiration for his character must not revolve around such claims, or his doubtful status as the sole reason the conquest succeeded. If Cortes is to be admired at all, it is because he played the political game so ruthlessly and masterfully. His enemies at home were certainly direr of a threat than those in Mexico, though not as immediate. That he overcame them so completely with his manipulations, though perhaps only after his death, speaks volumes about his political acumen. Indeed, he might very well be a prime candidate to update Machiavelli’s classic, a dubious honor but one that takes skill nonetheless. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Letters from Mexico &lt;/em&gt;is an interesting primary document, certainly one that must be considered in any survey of the literature of the conquest. But it must be taken for what it is, a self-serving attempt to justify actions after the fact, rather than an accurate retelling of events that took place. In the end, the letters say more about Cortes than the history he survived, making it more of a psychological study of the writer than a history of his times. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSj5yOK_mt4&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a link to Neil Young’s “Cortez the Killer.”&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-571155880953464636?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Hernan (or Fernando) Cortes is a difficult figure to like.  After reading the Pagden edition of his &lt;em&gt;cartas&lt;/em&gt;, however, he is, by the end of the volume, not impossible to respect in a grudging sort of way. He is, if nothing else, a consummate politician, at least until he is rewarded with the recognition and position he had so long sought. More so than the chronicle of Bernal Diaz del Castillo, the &lt;em&gt;Letters from Mexico &lt;/em&gt;illustrate the truly precarious political situation Cortes and his followers placed themselves in by their hasty departure from Cuba in 1519. In particular, the enigmatic &amp;#8220;First Letter,&amp;#8221; ostensibly written by the Municipal Council of Vera Cruz (does anyone really believe it was in any sense a group effort, not dictated by Cortes?) speaks volumes about the extralegal nature of their enterprise. Indeed, is not monarchy built upon not just the power of the sovereigns but the delegated authority of their lieutenants at court and their governors abroad? Cortes understod full well that he was steping outside of what we call the chain of command; and while letters to the Crown were not uncommon, as Pagden and Elliot (and Restall) tell us, such a detailed defense of one&amp;#8217;s actions must have been seen, at least in some court circles, as the height of impropriety. And I cannot help but wonder: Does a close reading of this First Letter reveal aspects of his personality and character that we do not see&amp;nbsp;elsewhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the Letters offer, in a sbtle way, a different perspective from which to understand the frustrations of Bernal Diaz and others, who came to feel that Cortes was purely in it for himself&amp;#8211;or at least, committing the cardinal sin of military command, saw to the interests of his men only after his own had been satisfied. Reading the Second Letter, one at times gets the impression that he, Cortes, is the only actor of consequence. While he mentions, repeatedly, the number of men with him, his style of writing (perhaps unconsciously) minimizes them. For example, on page 54 Cortes writes: &amp;#8220;Most Powerful Lord, I traveled for three days through the country and kigdom of Cempoal,  where I was very well received and accomodated by all the natives.&amp;#8221; The absence of the first-person plural, here and elsewhere, is striking. Granted, as a modern I am doubtless reading this in retrospect. That being said, I wonder whether this style of writing reveals more about this literary genre (as amended and expanded by Cortes), or about the author himself? When events seem to be going in Cortes&amp;#8217; favor, the pronoun &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8221; seems dominant, something Diaz no doubt caught in his own reading of the&amp;nbsp;Letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the Letters as a whole, and keeping in mind that each was written, at minimum, about a year apart, it is fascinating to witness how the rigors of his environment and the strain of looking out for the long-awaited recognition simply wear the man down. And, of course, even in his later letters Cortes is still the politician, still expert at governing his temper and self-censoring his outgoing mail. Given, that, the moments of exasperation in his later letters are all the more revealing. Early on, in 1519 and 1520, Cortes shows impressive, if disingenuous, diplomatic skills. In a fascinating (even if apocryphal) recounting of his reply to the messengers of Montezuma, he reportedly told them &amp;#8220;[T]hat were it in my power to return I would do so to please Mutezuma, but that I had come to this land by Your Majesty&amp;#8217;s commands, and the principal thing of which I had been ordered to give an account was of Mutezuma and his great city&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; (79-80).  The &amp;#8220;orders&amp;#8221; were fictitious, and the conversation related here almost certainly a fabrication, but the energy of the passage is evident. Cortes had an agenda, and he was not above working to achieve it, just as a modern ambasador smiles and shakes hands when it is the last thing he wants to do. As the dozens of months pass, however, Cortes presents himself as having become impatient with talking. In his Fifth Letter, during the Honduras expedition, Cortes and his men come across an Indian eating the flesh of another Indian, and immediately burns the malefactor (alive?) in the presence of the local lord. After getting everyone&amp;#8217;s attention, Cortes &lt;em&gt;then &lt;/em&gt;lectures them about the &amp;#8220;lies and deceits&amp;#8221; of the Devil&amp;nbsp;(351-2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read the Letters, however, if is the Fourth that stands out&amp;#8211;the last one written before Cortes was informed that he had, at last, been granted the recognition he felt he so richly deserved. The Fourth Letter is both more obsequious and more desperate in tone. (Reading it, I wonder if, had Cortes &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;soon after received official sanction from the Crown, he would have slid off into madness.)  His high manner of addressing Charles becomes more frequent, and increasingly adverbial: &amp;#8220;Your Catholic Majesty&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Most Excellent Prince&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Your Caesarean Majesty&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Invincible Caesar&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Your Majesty&amp;#8217;s Invincible Yoke&amp;#8221;, until, finally, &amp;#8220;Your Sacred and Caesarean&amp;nbsp;Majesty.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Fourth Letter focuses more on what Cortes &lt;em&gt;intends&lt;/em&gt; to do, rather than what he has recently done. It is as if, his current exploits having failed to win recognition, his last-ditch effort is to impress his sovereign with his future plans in the&amp;nbsp;Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most telling, to my mind, of the frustration, and looming bitterness, felt by the author is his increasing emphasis on religion. On page 332, Cortes again writes of the willingness of the indigenous peoples to be converted to Christianity, but have not, for want of priests. When Cortes writes &amp;#8220;I would once again remind Your Highness and beseech You to send them with all haste, because Our Lord God will be greatly served thereby,&amp;#8221; he seems to be reminding Charles of his duties as a Catholic&amp;nbsp;monarch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Letters from Mexico&lt;/em&gt; can be an exhausting read. The sheer volume of detail is remarkable, and Cortes, to his credit, achieved a lasting fame, if not quite that which he sought. Without the letters, the study of the fall of Mesoamerica would, I believe,  more closely resemble the fall of the empires of deep antiquity, shrouded more in legend than in&amp;nbsp;fact.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I have drawn much of my body of scholarship from early medieval letter collections, and therefore I have spent a lot of time thinking about letters as a historical source.  That being said, I was very excited delve into the Cortes letter collection.  At the same time, I expected to find something very different in this text.  The early medieval letter collections that I have used have all been collections that were published and promulgated for a public consumption, either by the author, a prominent recipient of letters, or sometimes by heirs.  These letters tend, therefore, to be highly polished versions of actual letters, and the collections are often arranged thematically, rather than chronologically.  The end result is a collection of letters meant to be regarded as literature, not an authentic private correspondence between associates.  In many cases, it is not even clear if the authors ever even sent these letters to their listed recipients, or if they were merely composed for publication.  I have often regarded this type of letter collection as a peculiar phenomenon of the ancient world, stretching back to Cicero, forming the bulk of the New Testament, and gaining prominence as a leading form of art during the period of late antiquity.  I assumed, therefore, that the Cortes collection would contain authentic private correspondence to friends and family in Spain, and offer readers a glimpse into the character and private life of this important historical&amp;nbsp;figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I was very wrong.  These highly polished, official communiqués to the central government bear little resemblance to my expectations of what a letter should be.  Rather, these letters seem to be little more than chapters in a narrative history with some salutations and felicities attached.  Cortes even goes so far as to engage in many of the tropes associated with formal narrative chronicles, such as using the “my writing sucks” topos.  Furthermore, Cortes hints that these letters were meant for a purpose other than the stated aim of informing the sovereign about affairs in New Spain.  At the end of some of these letters, Cortes usually mentions that he has also sent some other form of communication in addition to this letter.  At the end of the second letter, for example, Cortes writes “and in another letter which I send with this one, I beg Your Royal Excellency …,” clearly indicating that the real matters of state were to be dealt with in another form.  In the third letter, Cortes writes “of all this, the representatives who are now leaving New Spain will give a more detailed account to Your Majesty.”  All of this makes me wonder about the real form of communication within the early Spanish Empire and whom Cortes expected would read these letters.  For one thing, it seems that the real matters of state were being addressed by other forms of communication, either by a second letter, in person by the bearer of the letter, or by copies of ordinances that Cortes had issued.  These letters, then, seem to have served a less-than-official purpose, and I wonder if they were not in fact meant more for public consumption.  That these letters were collected into a codex while the other communications were not seems to suggest this.  I look forward to learning more about official communication within the Spanish Empire and also about the manuscript tradition for this text next&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;

            <id>/history561/posts/on-diaz-iii-castile-castile-tlaxcala-tlaxcala.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;One of the most striking things I found in Diaz&amp;#8217;s narrative was the place of indigenous allies- granted, at times they are marginalized, but they also appear frequently and sometimes with full (or at least considerable) respect and recognition. It becomes increasingly clear as the narrative unfolds that calling this the &amp;#8216;Spanish Conquest&amp;#8217; is deeply misleading. The ranks of Castilian and Tlaxcalan becomes harder to distinguish; in the final grueling chapter of back-and-forth urban/aquatic warfare, the alliance is always in view, even when the allies take a temporary break- a Tlaxcala cacique suggests a winning strategy for weakening the Mexica supply-lines, and Diaz admits the impetuous Spaniards could not have proposed it themselves. Certainly, Diaz projects his own people as being at the fore, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t take a particularly close reading to see the vital importance of Diaz&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;brothers&amp;#8217; as he calls them. The most remarkable expression of the multi-ethnic, if you will, nature of the campaign is in the two instances of the joint battle-cry in which Castile and Tlaxcala are linked together, two polities under one great King, united under a common Lord (temporal for certain and increasingly the same spiritual Lord, leaving aside the question of what a converting Tlaxcala thought exactly of his new comrades&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;faith).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Diaz&amp;#8217;s eyes, the symmetry between the two groups is more important than cultural differences: the indigenous nobility are an especially important point of contact and understanding and interpretation for Diaz. Whether noble women being given in marriage (whose status within the text is quite distinct from the &amp;#8216;pretty Indian women&amp;#8217; Diaz and the others wrangle over further along) or the various chiefs and lords with whom the Castilians both spar and ally, or even Montezuma (and, at the very end, Guatemoc), Diaz is quite capable of perceiving and depicting these men and women as worthy of honour and respect, even admiration. On this level, Diaz is quite comfortable with retaining the indigenous &amp;#8216;inscription&amp;#8217; of themselves, even as he desires and endorses a change of religious structure. He is able to sympathetically imagine indigenous social structures and the individuals that make them up, and disentangle them to some extent at least from those elements that he finds more distasteful. Even the Spaniards&amp;#8217; unremitting enemies can earn respect for their bravery- the theme of respect and even admiration for one&amp;#8217;s enemies harkening back to the Crusades. Indeed, this same power of sympathetic imagination with those perceived to be similar to oneself, especially the elite nobility and their ways of doing things, is reminiscent of Crusader accounts, right down to the important- but often fairly isolate- criticism of religious&amp;nbsp;practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of manipulating the past and out memory and perceptions on behalf of present concerns, this sympathetic imagination- within limits, albeit- is certainly a refreshing contrast to the ideological blinkering of the modern age. Whether dealing with class enemies or terrorists, the tendency of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries seems to be more towards an ideological collapse of the enemy, into a mere pastiche of evil, an empty caricature to be filled with the ideologues&amp;#8217; fear and hatred. The Islamic terrorist, for instance, has no motivations beyond hatred and violence (&amp;#8216;terror&amp;#8217; embracing everything), and can be brooked no grounds whatsoever for admiration or respect, but can only be castigated and demonized. For Diaz, in keeping with medieval precedents, one can simultaneously imagine the non-Christian enemy, the enemy Other, as vile and demonic, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; as a brave and courageous fighter, who more often than not partakes- or is perceived to partake at least- of roles and practices also found in one&amp;#8217;s own society, erasing some of the distance. The Mexica may cut your comrade&amp;#8217;s heart out and eat it, but you can still honour their nobles and admire the wonders of their vast city and its floating gardens. And even if this sympathetic imagination is limited to texts, if one so wished to argue, it is still there in the texts, and even that is something but rarely found in the modern&amp;nbsp;age&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;La Malinche, she is everywhere present, unsteady, constantly moving, transforming, just under the few words, relatively speaking, allotted her in Diaz&amp;#8217;s story. Sold by her own mother/step father/ brother, she appears in one town after another, accumulating languages, accumulating lovers/owners/husbands/companions, accumulating meanings, still accumulating meanings, now. Under Diaz&amp;#8217;s pen, she becomes Joseph, whose Biblical story perhaps at once suggests itself to Diaz and shapes Diaz&amp;#8217;s memory. Sold by her family, wrested from her homeland Dona Marina becomes a stranger, an outsider, intruding but still noble, still intelligent, still beautiful (she is Yusuf of the Qur&amp;#8217;an, whom the women stab their hands over in love- coincidence?- probably, but still&amp;#8230;). She is still capable of acting, her blood still runs noble. It is all- all these wrenching transformations/translations- for the good (but whose good? her people&amp;#8217;s? her&amp;#8217;s? what is her good, anyway? the Spaniards&amp;#8217;?), for her cultural/geographic migrations, her accumulated strata, are the key to everything. She is the Prologue, the Genesis that enters into the end of the story, her bones are borne on and on in Mexican history, have yet to come to&amp;nbsp;rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is Joseph, her accumulated wisdom, stored up in the unhappy prisonhouse of her pre-Spanish, pre-Christian days, wisdom that she presents to the Pharaoh, wisdom through which she interprets/translates the dream-world that spins madly out more and more the closer they come to the Floating City; yet when the Hispano-Tlaxcala alliance reaches their goal, she largely fades into the background. When at last, having reached her apogee of power and nobility, she rediscovers her traitorous family, she, Joseph-Marina, weeps and embraces them. All is well: the breaks, the weight of the accumulations, disappear in love and forgiveness. But this comes early in the narrative; before the gates of the great city, she disappears. But her bones live on, like Joseph&amp;#8217;s, her people (but who are her people?) finding themselves in a new land,  a restless land&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is one of the heroes of this tale, indeed one of the few unambiguous heroes, maybe the only one. She is a Joseph-figure, but she is more than a Joseph figure: she is in a long line of women praised for &amp;#8216;manly virtue&amp;#8217;; in battle she does not fear, and her loyalty is unswerving. Her place in the world is at once clear and at once ambiguous: not only can she translate, she can melt back into her &amp;#8216;native&amp;#8217; milieu, and receive knowledge- interpret the shape of things- that others cannot have. Again, like Joseph, she is between multiple worlds, and not just &amp;#8216;indigenous&amp;#8217; (which is, of course, multiple worlds in reality) and&amp;nbsp;Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;1. Sensory perception runs through Diaz&amp;#8217;s account, from memories of rainy nights and little food to vivid smells to a vast range of visual media both indigenous and Spanish. The olfactory has a decided presence:  Bodies lie putrid on the battlefield. The charnel-house temples Diaz remembers for us stink so strongly he can barely stand them. At nearly every peaceful meeting between Spanish and indigenous there is incense, the smoke &amp;#8216;fumigating&amp;#8217; the Spaniards as a sign of honor. Smell pervades Diaz&amp;#8217;s memories: smell, burrowed into the brain, hanging over the reconstructed/constructed remembering of an old&amp;nbsp;Spaniard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Sight: The image of the Virgin and Child Cortes presents to the subdued town- Diaz repaints it for us in his text, and clears the pagan underbrush anew, erasing the foul-looking Idols and painting in their place the hallowed Lady and Son. They set them up, so that the indigenous &amp;#8216;would see how well it would go with them.&amp;#8217; Seeing is becoming; the image is transformation, is the visual inscribing of Spanish dominion, of the dominion of the Cross the Spanish bring. Everywhere they go the Spaniards inscribe the sign of the Cross, setting up crosses in temple-complexes, placing them along roadsides, consciously recasting the landscape while also retaining the landscape with much of its significance (the crosses and images of the Virgin and Child are, significantly, placed in the old temples, scrubbed clean and whitewashed). The Spaniards cut the sign of the cross into the ceiba tree, because even when its bark grows back the sign will remain. The tree remains the tree, but it is not the same. It has been inscribed with a mark that will last forever, that is re-inscribed by Diaz, traced in tree after tree, an image of an image of an image, tree from tree to tree. On and&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mexica paint through Diaz&amp;#8217;s pen: script through painting, turned script again: thrice-written, thrice, four times refracted, from text to paint to text to text to text-in-translation. So multiple translations, and only the reimagined lines remain in place. Numerous times Diaz describes, often in admiring detail, the paintings the Mexica and others employed: here, he investigates and recalls for us the image of the Spaniards, having now passed through the channels of Mexica observation and interpretation, then through Diaz, then onto the page and finally to us. More layers&amp;#8230; All these texts, these visual signs, inscribed, interpreted, stuck in Diaz&amp;#8217;s mind enough to be re-imagined, re-inscribed, and now we receive them, repaint them through his words, our associations. The process of memory goes&amp;nbsp;on&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico &lt;/em&gt;is an interesting read.  Días chronicles his time as a conquistador in the sixteenth century providing a deeply entailed primary source for what occurred in Mexico.  However, the tone of the book was different from other primary documents I have read.  Usually there is an air of superiority that comes through that makes the author seem as though he knows everything which is going on and seems to write as if he is out of his own body and just observing.  With Días’ work it was much more casual.  I don’t mean this to sound strange but as I was reading is was like listening to one of my uncles tell a crazy story about what he did when he was in the military.  But I liked how it was more casual and he included how bad things were it made it seem more real then a piece of propaganda sent back to the Spanish homeland to encourage people to invest and settle in the new world.  Another aspect I liked were the inserted notes about historical facts.  I found it broke up the monotony and filled in places that were not so well explained by&amp;nbsp;Días.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there were some aspects of the work that I took issue with.  The biggest being when it was written.  For it to be such a detailed and extensive volume writing it 30 plus years afterward does not seem quite right.  There has to be holes and places were he could not remember what happened and just filled things in, I don’t know about everyone else but I have a hard time remembering things in such vivid detail.  And I will admit that he did mention in some sections that he had forgotten what happened but it would stand to reason more than a little had to have been embellished or influenced from other sources.  But hey, maybe the guy had an incredible memory you never&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other issues I had did not so much have to do with Días but with how the Spanish preserved things that were happening around them.  It bothers me to no end how he keeps repeating how they were there to civilize the natives I mean even Caesar would have been impressed by the construction of Mexico.  Another issue what the confusion between human sacrifice and cannibalism it  seems in the book that they automatically assumed if they were sacrificing they were being cannibals as well which was not always the case.  I’m not an expert but I don’t think human was mane part of the diet in South America.  And as I was talking to a friend of mine about the book the Spanish themselves perform a symbolic act of cannibalism when they take mass………. but that is whole other argument.  The last thing that I found strange was Montezuma himself.  He knew what hell was about to walk into his territory and he tried to avert it but actually made it worse.  In reading how he sent messengers offering gold to Cortes if he would go no further just made the Spanish thirst for wealth worse……its almost to crazy to imagine what was going through Montezuma’s mind and Cortes manipulated the situation to no end so he could get to&amp;nbsp;Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Texts from Medieval&amp;nbsp;Spain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chronica Hispana Saeculi &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;XII&lt;/span&gt;, Part I&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Corpus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Christianorum Continuatio Mediaevalis &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;LXXI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Edited by Emma Falque, Juan Gil, and Antonio Maya. Turnholt: Brepols,&amp;nbsp;1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Corpus Christianorum&lt;/em&gt; is a major publishing undertaking by Brepols, a Belgian publisher.  The notion is to publish scholarly manuscripts dealing with texts of a loosely defined &amp;#8220;Christian Age.&amp;#8221;  The majority of publications treat Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.  This volume contains textual editions and scholarly prefatory material of four twelfth-century Spanish chronicles composed in Latin: &lt;em&gt;Historia Roderici vel Gesta Roderici Campidocti&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Carmen Campidoctoris&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Chronica Adefonsi Imperatoris&lt;/em&gt;; and &lt;em&gt;Prefatio de Almaria&lt;/em&gt;.  Each of these works records a narrative account of a Castilian military operations against the Spanish Muslim polities in the eleventh or twelfth century.  These texts, therefore, are of particular importance in presenting the historical background to the Spanish conquest of the Americas, but also in providing examples of the literary tradition in which Bernal Diaz del Castillo&amp;nbsp;wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The World of El Cid: Chronicles of the Spanish Reconquest&lt;/em&gt;. Translated and annotated by Simon Barton and Richard Fletcher. Manchester, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;: Manchester University Press,&amp;nbsp;2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An English translation of some of the texts in &lt;em&gt;Chronica Hispana Saeculi &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;XII&lt;/span&gt;, Part&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Deeds of James I of Aragon: A Translation of the Medieval Catalan Llibre dels Fets&lt;/em&gt;. Translated by Damian Smith and Helena Buffery. Aldershot: Ashgate,&amp;nbsp;2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An English translation of the autobiographical account of James I of Aragon, known as &amp;#8220;The Conqueror&amp;#8221; (Jaume el Conqueridor in Catalan, Jaime el Conquistador in Castlian) composed in the middle of the Thirteenth Century.  James oversaw the most impressive Catalonian-Aragonese expansion of the Reconquista, taking Valencia and the Balearic Islands during the course of his reign.  His account is significant for the literary tradition in which Bernal Diaz del Castillo wrote because it is autobiographical in nature, written as a first-person narrative, and composed in the author&amp;#8217;s vernacular (Catalan) rather than in&amp;nbsp;Latin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Las Siete Partidas&lt;/em&gt; (Five volumes). Translated by Samuel Parsons Scott; edited by Robert I Burns, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;S.J.&lt;/span&gt; Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,&amp;nbsp;2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An English translation of the legal code drawn up by the thirteenth-century Castilian monarch Alfonso X &amp;#8220;The Wise.&amp;#8221;  &lt;em&gt;Las Siete Partidas&lt;/em&gt; has been revised many times since its original composition, but it still forms the basis of much local law throughout the Spanish-speaking world, and even in the American Southwest.  Las Siete Partidas formally codified much of the practices of the Reconquista, and by extension the Spanish conquest of the Americas.  Furthermore, this text is important in that it marks the turn from the composition of official documents in Latin to composing official documents in the Castilian&amp;nbsp;vernacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Accounts of the Conquest of&amp;nbsp;Mexico&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cortes: The Life of the Conqueror by His Secretary Francisco Lopez de Gomara&lt;/em&gt;. Translated from the &lt;em&gt;Istoria de la Conquista de Mexico&lt;/em&gt; by Lesley Byrd Simpson. Berkeley: University of California Press,&amp;nbsp;1964.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in various editions during the late Sixteenth Century, Lopez&amp;#8217;s account of the conquest of Mexico is derived from personal interviews with members of the expedition, and a close personal relationship with Cortes.  However, both contemporaries and modern scholars have criticized the accuracy of Lopez&amp;#8217;s narrative, and have credited Lopez as the source of much of the mythology surrounding the&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Broken Spears: The Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico&lt;/em&gt;. Edited by Miguel Leon-Portilla, translated from Nahuatl into Spanish by Angel Maria Garibay, English translation by Lysander Kemp. Boston: Beacon Press,&amp;nbsp;1962.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collection of various Nahuatl-language accounts of the Spanish conquest of Mexico.  The book is organized as a chronological narrative, though this structure is completely superficial, with portions of independent accounts cobbled together to form a cohesive whole.  Additionally, not all of the text consulted are Nahuatl, but rather, are Spanish translations of indigenous texts.  Still, this book offers a perspective on the conquest that differs from the Spanish&amp;nbsp;chronicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary Works about the&amp;nbsp;Conquest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maltby, William S. &lt;em&gt;The Rise and Fall of the Spanish Empire&lt;/em&gt;. New York City: Palgrave Macmillan,&amp;nbsp;2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new general account of the Spanish Empire by an expert on the reign of Charles V.  Maltby begins with a chapter on the central- and late-medieval Spain and ends with the wars of independence in Latin America.  Maltby&amp;#8217;s emphasis is on the political history of the empire, but he gives equal weight to European and overseas&amp;nbsp;possessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todorov, Tzvetan. &lt;em&gt;The Conquest of America: The Question of the Other&lt;/em&gt;. New York City: Harper &lt;span class=&#34;amp&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Row,&amp;nbsp;1984.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally published in French as &lt;em&gt;La Conquete de l&amp;#8217;Amerique&lt;/em&gt; in 1982.  Tzvetan Todorov is a refugee from Communist Bulgaria and has lived in France since the 1960s.  Todorov&amp;#8217;s work is considered a classic, and must be addressed by any scholar working on the conquest.  In the early 1980s, this was a ground-breaking work that looked at the conquest with the disciplinary tools of the social sciences, but also attempted to draw broad philosophical conclusions from actions in the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary Works about the Primary Accounts of the Conquest of&amp;nbsp;Mexico&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beckjord, Sarah H. &lt;em&gt;Territories of History: Humanism, Rhetoric, and the Historical Imagination in the Early Chronicles of Spanish America&lt;/em&gt;. University Park, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;PA&lt;/span&gt;: The Pennsylvania State University Press,&amp;nbsp;2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Beckjord applies post-modern literary criticism to several of the narrative accounts of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, including Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo, Bartolome de Las Casas, and Bernal Diaz del Castillo.  Beckjord seeks to put these authors into the context of Renaissance Humanism, and grapples with any of the famous assertions of Hayden White.  Beckjord concludes that while many of the elements of these narratives are especially literary, their authors were consciously crafting works that they thought of as distinctly&amp;nbsp;historical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carman, Glen. &lt;em&gt;Rhetorical Conquests: Cortes, Gomara, and Renaissance Imperialism&lt;/em&gt;. West Lafayette, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt;: Purdue University Press,&amp;nbsp;2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carman seeks to place the chronicle sources into the context of Renaissance rhetoric by analyzing the texts according to Renaissance rhetorical theory and by demonstrating the importance of rhetorical training for the leaders and chroniclers of the conquest and for the intended audience of the&amp;nbsp;accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;The Life and Family of Bernal Diaz del&amp;nbsp;Castillo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernal Diaz was born in Castile around 1495.  In 1514, Diaz participated in the expedition of Pedrarias Avila to establish a Castilian colony in Panama, and in 1517 and 1518 he participated in expeditions on the Yucatan coast.   Between 1519 and 1522, he joined Hernan Cortes in the conquest of Mexico.  Diaz later went on the Cortes expedition to&amp;nbsp;Honduras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the expedition to Honduras, Bernal Diaz settled for a time on an &lt;em&gt;encomienda&lt;/em&gt; in Mexico where he wrote his &lt;em&gt;probanza de merito&lt;/em&gt;, which can still be found in the Archivo de Indias in Seville.  Diaz returned to Spain twice to plead his case for a pension, but ultimately he settled in Guatemala.  On his &lt;em&gt;encomienda&lt;/em&gt; there, Diaz concerned himself with establishing a community and a family.  Around 1555, Diaz began his memoir, &lt;em&gt;Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espana&lt;/em&gt;.  Diaz died in&amp;nbsp;1584.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva&amp;nbsp;Espana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memoir is in part another attempt to gain a pension from the Spanish crown, but also a response to the account by Francisco Lopez de Gomara published in 1552.  Lopez&amp;#8217;s account was simplified, journalistic narrative taken from interviews, mostly of Cortes himself.  Diaz seems to have felt slighted by Lopez&amp;#8217;s treatment and wrote an account to minimize Cortes&amp;#8217;s role as an inspired military&amp;nbsp;leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one version of the manuscript was sent to Spain in 1575.  A friar there added to the manuscript, and this version was published in 1632.  Additionally, manuscripts were kept in Guatemala, at least one of which was edited by Bernal Diaz&amp;#8217;s son.  In 1904 a scholar published a version based on the Guatemala manuscripts, claiming that it was as Bernal Diaz intended it, without&amp;nbsp;additions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Diaz and the conquistadors themselves, the &lt;em&gt;Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espana&lt;/em&gt; stands at the threshold of two eras.  Diaz drew heavily on the traditions of the Latin chronicle that can trace its roots to early Rome.  Medieval Spain had a rich corpus of chronicles that narrated the military conquest of Al-Andalus (some examples can be found on the Zotero Group Library).  In many ways Diaz&amp;#8217;s work bears a striking resemblance to these narratives, with its concern about military action, spoils, and proper modes of behavior.  At the same time, it is very different, composed in the first-person and in the vernacular.  Indeed, Diaz&amp;#8217;s work resembles closely the &lt;em&gt;Llibre dels Fets&lt;/em&gt; of king James I of Aragon, also written in the first-person vernacular, and also in some ways an apologetic response to critics (also listed on the Zotero Group Library).  Recent studies have concentrated on the debt Diaz and other contemporary chroniclers owed to Renaissance rhetoric and to Humanism (examples can be found on the Zotero Group&amp;nbsp;Library).&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;The most subtle and noteworthy aspect of this week’s reading was how much sense it made.   The book was, for the most part, exactly what I expected.  The question that I’m forced to ask here is: Why?   Considering Restall’s seven myths of the conquest it seems as though, at least Diaz’s account of the conquest of Mexico, has had a profound impact on the way that epic/ heroic fiction was written subsequently in Western Europe.   I really enjoy a good fictional read (i.e. Louis L’Amour, Robert Jordan, or George &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;R.R.&lt;/span&gt; Martin) and Diaz seemed so familiar that I am forced to acknowledge the debt I owe to his work.   Without his style, force, and clarity the types of books that I enjoy today might not have been written the same way.  Aspects of the seven myths, built I think at least in part by his narrative style, show up over and over again in the types of fictional works that I read and even in popular television programs.  This is the stuff that the dreams of people in the United States are made of.  Being accounts written by a Spanish conquistador, I must also ask myself why a “foreign” work could have had so much influence on the English speaking world.   The answer that first comes to mind is guilt.  Why couldn’t the English speakers have had such a glorious conquest?  Perhaps it’s this need, coupled with the tenacity, style, and flair in Diaz’s work that have made it so influential.  My current answer may be too simplistic, but hopefully as I think on it more I will be able to develop a better&amp;nbsp;hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Pondering Diaz del&amp;nbsp;Castillo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in his chronicle of the Spanish conquest, Bernal Diaz del Castillo&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At that moment, there sallied from another house, which was an oratory of their Idols, ten Indians clad in long white cotton cloaks, reaching to their feet, and with their long hair reeking with blood, and so matted together, that it could never be parted or even combed out again, unless it were cut.  These were the priests of the Idols … and by signs they made us understand that we should quit their land before the firewood which they had piled up there should burn out, otherwise they would attack us and kill us”&amp;nbsp;(10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to believe that Diaz del Castillo could possibly remember all of this 35 years later—especially such nitpicky quantitative details such as numbers of priests and the fiber content of their clothing.  In the terrified heat of the moment, did he count them—all ten—and run his fingers through their hair to determine its resistance to a comb?  Clearly this is poetic&amp;nbsp;license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the memory of a very old conquistador, written decades later, to vindicate himself, and as he admits, to give something to his children because he has nothing else to give them.  But that is not to say that much cannot be gleaned from a careful reading of &lt;em&gt;The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico.&lt;/em&gt; It relates a great deal about the Spanish mindset, perceptions, cultural biases, and the literary form of the &lt;em&gt;probanza&lt;/em&gt;.  As such, it perfectly illustrates the seven myths Matthew Restall talks about in his phenomenal book, &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths of the Spanish&amp;nbsp;Conquest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diaz de Castillo regales his reader with tales of Spanish bravery, heroism, pluck, ingenuity.  He writes, “No one can appreciate the excessive hardships who has not passed through them as we did” (14), and “Let the curious reader consider whether there is not much to ponder over in this that I am writing.  What men have there been in the world who have shown such daring?” (192).   Diaz del Castillo does his very best to present himself and his comrades as the “great men” that history remembered for so&amp;nbsp;long…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of the myths that Restall unpacks, the myth of miscommunication, is clear in Diaz’ account when one reads between the lines.  Interpreters operate in murky middle ground between the two worlds, and it is clear that while there was communication, it was incomplete.  One can easily see how Lockhart’s concept of Double Mistaken Identity would come into play.  For instance, Diaz del Castillo describes an event early in the campaign when Aguilar began translating for Cortés:  “Aguilar spoke to them … and asked them to …permit us to tell the Calachones things which would be to their advantage and to the service of God our Lord, but they still persisted in saying that if we advanced beyond the palm trees they would kill us”  (48).  Religious terms and concepts might be easily misread by both cultures, but the threat of violence was communicated clearly.  Malintzin, the most famous interpreter of the conquest, (or Doña Marina as Diaz calls her) is a tragic figure—given away by her mother, traded amongst groups of Mesoamerican peoples, she finally is given to Cortés by the Tabasco people.  She is an interesting literary figure here, often described with patronizing compliments, such as having “courage passing that of woman” (135).  Other Indian women are similarly treated, several times being labeled “pretty for an Indian” or some such variation of the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting point of communication is that Diaz continually mentions giving the Indians green and blue beads.  He does not discuss the significance of this color choice, but apparently the Spaniards had learned that beads of this color pleased the Indians and were a good bartering tool.  Today, Mesoamerican archaeology has demonstrated that the color green and bluegreen especially had an important spiritual significance— they were associated with water and plants, the life force as it were, and beads of jadeite were even placed in the mouths of the dead  (see Susan Toby Evans, &lt;em&gt;Ancient Mexico and Central America: Archaeology and Culture History&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;131).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diaz del Castillo informs his readers in the beginning that Cortés’ standards and banners said “Comrades, let us follow the sign of the holy Cross with true faith, and through it we shall conquer”  (33).  He continues on this theme throughout the book.  This is one thing which Diaz del Castillo seems convinced was always perfectly translated.  According to Diaz, in each town Cortés “explained to them very clearly all thr matters concerning our holy faith” (180).  An impossibility, to be sure&amp;nbsp;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading Diaz del Castillo, several myths stood out in high relief, but I kept being struck by the myths of “Great Men” and myths of “(Mis)Communication.”   Having read Matthew Restall provided invaluable context, and allowed me to glean much more historical truth from Diaz del Castillo’s mythologized, &lt;em&gt;probanza&lt;/em&gt;-esque account of the&amp;nbsp;conquest.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Unlike other chronicles, such as the highly entertaining  &amp;#8220;Chronicles&amp;#8221; of Froissart or the page-turning  &amp;#8220;Commentaries&amp;#8221; of Caesar, Bernal Diaz&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;The Discovery and Cnquest of Mexico&amp;#8221; presents an immediacy and intimacy that the others lack. Froissart did not bear witness to most of the events he describes, and Caesar always refers to himself in the third person. Diaz, although writing decades after the events he describes, clearly retained a sharp memory into old age; despite the occasional errors and omissions (thoughtfully noted by the early twentieth-century interpreter, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;A. P.&lt;/span&gt; Maudslay) it is no mystery why Bernal Diaz has come to be remembered as one of the principle figures of the Mesoamerican Conquest, after Cortes himself. In the process of writing the &amp;#8220;true history&amp;#8221; of that process&amp;#8211;to counter the starry-eyed hagiographers of Cortes&amp;#8211;Diaz has assured his place in the broader history of the fifteenth&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortes, as viewed through Diaz&amp;#8217;s eyes (and years upon years of recollection) is far from perfect. Certainly he is not the demigod of myth and legend. Throughout the text, for example, Diaz takes pains to remind his audience that Cortes was obliged always to speak through an interpreter&amp;#8211;Dona Marina, we are told again and again, was always at the Captain&amp;#8217;s side. Why is this? My guess is that, on some level, Diaz wished to impress upon his readership that Cortes was a man like any other, one who was obliged to operate within the confines of his situation and the limitations of his own abilities.  (Or perhaps I am reading too much into this; perhaps Diaz only wished to give due credit to Dona Marina, who clearly was in an awkward&amp;nbsp;situation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too, Diaz presents Cortes as the consummate politician, a keen reader and manipulator of men; on more than one occassion Cortes solicits opinions from his lieutenants in an effort to convince them of their own influence upon him. Having long since cosen a course of action, Cortes lead his men to believe &lt;em&gt;they &lt;/em&gt;convinced him. It is a brilliant, and global, tactic among great generals. Caesar certainly practiced it. For that matter, so did George Washington. While the reader should be cautious in reading into the text (as I have overtly done above), these episodes do reveal much about Diaz himself. Clearly he is a bright guy; despite his aversion to those who engage in &amp;#8220;lofty rhetoric in order to give lustre and repute to their statements&amp;#8221; he is as sharp as anyone else on the expedition. If anything, one wonders if his lack of formal erudition allows him to recognize things that others do&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strength of this work&amp;#8211;they key strength, in my view, too often absent from even the most readable chronicles in world history, is the intimacy it presents. One can read a magnificent synthesis of the Conquest, but Diaz provides the details. We see Cortes and Montezuma &lt;em&gt;laughing &lt;/em&gt;with each other (through the medium of the ubiquitous Dona Marina) in one of their early conversations, while they played a board game together. Later, Diaz mentions in passing that they held morning prayers in lieu of daily Mass, as the expedition had run out of wafers and wine for Communion. These small comments, this collection of anecdotes, removes the dust from history and reminds the reader that these were living, breathing human beings, in contingent situations and with their own (to one degree or another) agency. Granted, even re-reading this last sentence, I recognize it as a cliche.  Nevertheless, I think even the most competent historians should be reminded of it once in a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the Chronicle of Bernal Diaz, I am reminded of one of the first books I read on Latin American history. (Truly read; not merely for a graduate seminar, but for myself.  I came across Salvador de Madariaga&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;The Rise of the Spanish American Empire&amp;#8221; in a used bookstore for fifty cents. (Amazing, is it not, how sometimes the books we treasure are the ones we get for dirt cheap?) I was impressed with Professor Madariaga&amp;#8217;s articulation of the idea of the &lt;em&gt;body historic&lt;/em&gt;, and the necessary reminder that the Conquest was the beginning of a new and unprecedented civilization in human history. Diaz&amp;#8217;s account serves as a reminder that that event was anything but&amp;nbsp;preordained.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico&lt;/em&gt;, by Bernal Diaz Del Castillo, is a firsthand account of the Spanish incursion into Mexico, from the earliest explorations to the fall of the Mexican Empire. The author participated in two excursions prior to that of Cortes. That they were not successful, and the difficulty of subduing Mexico, disputes the myth of Spanish superiority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulk of the text is devoted to Cortes&amp;#8217; conquest of Mexico, accomplished more by securing allies than superior warfare. Indeed, Cortes seems more of a manipulator than a warrior. Cortes sneaked his way into heading the expedition. After scuttling the boats in which the party arrived, Cortes marched to Mexico, a city whose development amazed the Spanish. After kidnapping Montezuma and placing him under house arrest, the plan fell apart and Cortes and his party fled. After fending off a rival, he realigns himself with Native American allies and lays siege to Mexico. Though the Spanish lose many battles, they eventually outlast their foes and take the city. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work, as gripping as a centuries&amp;#8217; old primary document can be, is obviously hyperbolic. The Spanish come across as brave warriors who double as missionaries, fighting dogs with no honor or scruples. The mission is obviously blessed by God, who gets the credit for every victory. Throughout the work, the author claims that the Native Americans believed the Spanish to be the men from across the sea that were destined to rule. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the obvious problems of firsthand accounts, chiefly motivation and possible lapse of memory, the work is also a translation, which adds another layer to the questions of bias and motivations for telling the narrative. Does &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt; Maudslay, the translator, buy into the story or is he an impartial observer? For example, he states in his commentary that the fate of the Spanish might have been much worse than that of the Native Americans had they lost. What is missing is the fact that the Spanish were invaders trying to disrupt a way of life. Still, &lt;em&gt;The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico &lt;/em&gt;is a fascinating document when considered with its limitations, and an adventure story well worth reading regardless of its weaknesses.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-7704454804586417253?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Having recently read Matthew Restall&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest&lt;/em&gt;, reading Diaz&amp;#8217; account of the conquest of Mexico caused me to be on the lookout for the myths contained in this study.  How easy it was for me, after having read Restall, to see how Diaz managed to downplay the part played by Native American allies in the Conquest, as well as how many of those Native American used the Spanish conquistadors as pawns (so to speak) in their own agendas.  Diaz made the Spanish appear practically invincible due to their superior tactics, weaponry, and horses, while he made Monteczuma and others appear quite lacking in many respects.  One area where the author does not make the Native Americans appear lacking, however, is in their ferocity when it comes to making war.  In that respect, Diaz and the other Spanish conquistadors agreed, as many Spainards were killed or wounded during their many battles with Native&amp;nbsp;Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are many intriguing items which could be pulled from Diaz&amp;#8217; account, those which drew most of my attention included those instances involving Spainard-Native American communiques and the continual references within the text by Diaz to God, Jesus Christ, and the Catholic Mass.  For instance, in a blending of these two items of interest, Diaz portrays Cortes as continually preaching to the Native Americans the benefits of Catholicism over against the evils of their own &amp;#8220;superstitions.&amp;#8221;  Diaz wrote of one such occasion in which Cortes &amp;#8220;delivered a discourse to the &lt;em&gt;Caciques&lt;/em&gt; so fitting to the occasion that no good theologian could have bettered it.  Cortes said many things very well expressed, which they thoroughly understood&amp;#8221; (77).  Instances such as this one, and others in which communication between Cortes and various Native American peoples appeared to come off without any misunderstandings, certainly lend to a lack of credibility in regard to Diaz&amp;#8217; depiction of the Conquest.  And, Diaz&amp;#8217; continual references to God&amp;#8217;s hand at work in the events of the Conquest (which always benefitted the conquistadors) as well as his repeated assertions of the conquistadors (and especially Cortes) of attending Mass, appear to be the author&amp;#8217;s attempt to make the conquistadors God&amp;#8217;s own agents &amp;#8211; all of which fits neatly into Restall&amp;#8217;s study in which the conquistadors as well as their royal patrons wanted to justify their imperialistic claims on the lands and peoples of the&amp;nbsp;Americas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diaz&amp;#8217; account of the Conquest, while an engaging and at times very exciting read, is, as convicingly shown by Restall, truly a &lt;em&gt;probanza de merito&lt;/em&gt;, designed to make the conquistadors appear heroic and deserving of&amp;nbsp;riches.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Restall’s &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest&lt;/em&gt; takes a very realistic account of what actually occurred in the Americas.  By breaking down the most common myths behind the conquest Restall endeavors to reveal how the “conquest” succeeded.  However, I can’t day the book was entirely interesting.  The format of the book seemed to take a laundry list of events and dates which seemed to overwhelm you while you read.  For my tastes I would have preferred more discussion on the part of the author that expanded the perspective into other areas of the myth&amp;nbsp;creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main themes that Restall touches on are important ones, however, they seem to be over thought in a way.  In studying humans in there many forms of culture one begins to realize how similar behavior is across the board.  Many of the chapters go on about how native populations were not victimized to the extent that is believed but were actively involved in aiding the conquistadors.  The idea of victimization developed later as a consequence to the Spanish repercussions.  Restall is right in emphasizing the role of disease.  I become increasingly more convinced the historical outcome of both North and South America would have been far different if the populations were resistant to disease.  Populations that did form a resistance found ways of adapting and creating a hybridized way of life that could have coexisted with the&amp;nbsp;Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book may have not been the ideal way of looking at the conquest, but it did have good insight.  In our current cultural climate despite several hundred years of distance these myths still persist.  The Spanish conquistadors may have been blind going into the Americas but their ability to imprint themselves onto history is impressive.  It’s not that discovering America was the more important events in our history it is how we have cocooned the idea of what actually happened and formed a total blindness to reality that is the important aspect of our culture.  It’s not that we remember that is important its important how we have remembered.  Maybe that is what is missing from Restall’s work.  He goes to great lengths to detail the truth of what occurred and how the myths were initially conceived, perhapse what he needed was to explain how these myths are currently impacting us presently despite historians efforts to correct our history.  Course that probably would have been a far different book then what Restall&amp;nbsp;intended…………..&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://altarikh.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_0064.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5&#34; title=&#34;IMG_0064&#34; src=&#34;http://altarikh.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_0064.jpg?w=284&amp;#038;h=377&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;284&#34; height=&#34;377&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;Cristobal Colon atop a neo-Gothic column, Madrid,&amp;nbsp;Spain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;Much of history, especially the bits that have transpired in the past two thousand years or so, have their own life in the present: the events and people of the past are points around which great edifices and counter-edifices are erected and invested with all manner of importance, emotional charge, and value-laden judgments. The images of the past become explanations and justifications for the actions of the present, and with every use of history- for life or otherwise- these images become more deeply ingrained, more invested with emotional weight and ideological baggage.  The Spanish &amp;#8216;Conquest&amp;#8217; of the Americas is, even more than many other periods and events of the past, a deeply contested one, a period around which various people have built images and myths that they have in turn used to construct and support all manner of ideologies and programs of action. From indigenous protesters decrying Columbus Day celebrations to the late nineteenth century founders of those celebrations,  the people and events of the &amp;#8216;Conquest&amp;#8217; are surrounded with layers and layers of image and ideas that have precious little to do with the past as it probably was, and very much to do with the concerns of subsequent generations. Any attempt at uncovering some semblance of historical truth regarding this period is fraught with difficulties, even if one does not hope to describe the Conquest &lt;em&gt;wie es eigentlich gewesen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;Matthew Restall&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths&lt;/em&gt; tackles, conveniently enough, seven such myths as promised in the title- seven conceptions, shaped in both &amp;#8216;popular culture&amp;#8217; and the academy, about the Conquest that often times have their roots in the self-projections and image-shapings of the Conquerors themselves, though some of the myths are much later inventions (such as the apotheosis of Christopher Columbus). As Restall notes in the introduction, all historians are subject to similar problems of limited perspective and their own preconceptions and ideologies that shape how they reconstruct history. Not an earth-shattering proposition, but always worth holding in mind. Even- perhaps as much so, or more so- twenty-first century historians have their own grid of values and ideologies upon which to build their reckoning of the past. Restall still contends for utility in history, and the possibility of some grasp of truth, contingent though it may&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;In unspinning each of the myths and then presenting a different construction of the aspect of the Conquest the myth deals with, we see not simply the period under consideration in a better light, but the ideological needs of the people who spun the myths in the first place, and those who continued to find them useful. Some of them- such as the desolation of the indigenous- has experienced life under very divergent ideologies, being used to herald the superiority of Western civilization, and to decry the same civilization for its genocidal brutality. The rather more complicated reality is decidedly less useful for ideology, as it reveals that the indigenous were perhaps not quite so noble (at least not in the way modern liberals or others might wish), nor Europeans quite so&amp;nbsp;superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;Indeed, one of the ironies Restall reveals throughout the book is that the very complexity of indigenous society in the Americas was one of the great assets of the Spanish. The existence of large empires and their disaffected subjects and peripheral polities- features not at all foreign to the European invaders- made the Conquest possible in many ways. Had the Spanish been forced to fight decentralized societies without pre-existing elites and pre-established patterns of taxation, levy, and deference to authority, their task would have been vastly more difficult (as it was in those parts of the nascent empire where indigenous peoples were semi-sedentary or nomadic and hence much harder to control). The fact of indigenous societal complexity, if not widespread political unity, meant not only pre-existing patterns of control, but the interstices into which the Spanish could insert themselves to manipulate a wide range of indigenous polities for Spanish ends. And as Restall continually points out, this process was interpreted by indigenous, not as Spanish conquest, but as essentially indigenous and hence &amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217; patterns- power struggles, civil wars- that happened to include the new power of the Spanish. That they could not foresee the eventual result of Spanish intervention is quite understandable. And after all, it could have gone otherwise. Nonetheless, in the end the Spanish were successful and often quite perspicacious  in their political and military wrangling among advanced, sophisticated polities. Yet at the same time the indigenous actors, thanks in part to their sophistication, were not helpless, but worked the process as well, seeking their advantages (or at least, as was usually the case here as elsewhere in the world, the advantages of the elite) in the midst of Spanish intrigues and politics.  We can hardly fault indigenous elites for not seeing the Spanish as a threat to the native peoples of the Americas- they had no reason to imagine themselves as any sort of cohesive whole with other peoples in the Americas, nor did they have reason to be especially concerned with those other polities. Just as good, maybe better, to be under a Spanish administrator as a Mexica one. Sometimes the devil you don&amp;#8217;t know can be preferable to the one you do, or so it might seem at the&amp;nbsp;time&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;But the reality of indigenous sophistication, their advanced polities and structured hierarchies of  educated elites, does not lend itself to many post-Conquest ideologies. For the Spanish conquistadors, their image was greatly magnified if they could lead people- perhaps themselves included- to imagine a tiny band of incredibly Spanish men creating a massive empire, single-handedly (other than the invisible hand of Providence, perhaps). For many later observers who see the Conquest as an evil, an instance of genocide even, the image of indigenous societies, looking much like European societies, and participating in the Conquest, is not a useful image either. The indigenous as victim, and as morally superior to the conquering European, is perhaps a more comfortable image, and certainly more useful&amp;nbsp;ideologically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;I also found myself wondering: perhaps the reality that it was as much the indigenous&amp;#8217; sophistication, their advanced and well-structured polities, that so often enabled the Spanish conquest- perhaps that reality gives us some pause. It&amp;#8217;s a little disconcerting when you realize that the indigenous peoples weren&amp;#8217;t some how just exceptionally unlucky or the Spanish exceptionally superior (though the unluckiness was pretty pronounced at least in terms of disease)- the collaboration of indigenous elites and the Spanish manipulation of their advanced polities is not at all exceptional, and makes perfect sense to anyone who has ever participated in similar polities. Our own advanced civilizations and complex polities can be the very tools that cut us down, whether we live in sixteenth century South America or the twenty-first century&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <id>/history561/posts/on-matthew-restalle28099s-seven-myths.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Restall starts his introduction with a quote from Felipe Fernández-Armesto: “Historians today are priests of a cult of truth, called to the service of a god whose existence they are doomed to doubt.”  Truer words were never spoken.  On one level, &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest&lt;/em&gt; is about debunking seven persistent myths about the Spanish Conquest and its indigenous and Spanish participants.  But on another level, Restall brilliantly engages questions of historical objectivity, how make sense of multiple and often conflicting accounts, and more.  In the Prologue, Restall says Spanish accounts are “inescapably framed by the concepts and language of their own culture” (xv).  In other words, the letters of Hernán Cortés and the histories of Gómara are not enough.  Restall digs into indigenous sources as well, having clearly mastered several languages.  That alone is no small accomplishment.  He also looks at academic books and even popular films.  For me, the “big point” is that we must examine subjectivity and truth, &lt;em&gt;question our own assumptions&lt;/em&gt;, and open-mindedly explore the social-cultural worlds of historical actors if we are ever going to begin to&amp;nbsp;understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restall understands.  He takes us through seven chapters describing the seven myths, which are: 1. The Myth of Exceptional Men, 2. The Myth of the King’s Army, 3. The Myth of the White Conquistador, 4. The Myth of Completion, 5.  The Myth of (Mis)Communication, 6. The Myth of Native Desolation, and 7. The Myth of&amp;nbsp;Superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the “Myth of Exceptional Men” addresses the pernicious idea that Cortés, Columbus, Pizarro and their ilk were some kind of supermen, possessing superhuman strength, intelligence, tactics, etc. that allowed their small bands of men to overcome thousands of indigenous warriors.  This is simply not the case.  We learn that the conquistadores were merely following patterns established during earlier phases of Caribbean conquest, patterns that date back to the brutal &lt;em&gt;Reconquista&lt;/em&gt; of Spain.  The big name conquistadores that we all remember from our high school history textbooks were not, in fact, big men.  They were mere humans, part of the historical process of empire expansion—which had, for the record, been occurring on both sides of the globe for quite some time—e.g. the Aztecs/Mexica took over their neighbors,&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next myth Restall takes down is the Myth of the King’s Army.  This one was a bit of a shocker for me.  Restall painstakingly proves that conquistadores were not paid, regular, trained, soldiers.  Rather, they were “armed entrepreneurs.”  As historian James Lockhart has pointed out, soldiers receive salaries, while conquistadores did not.  Locked into a culture of patronage, conquistadores had to write letters to Spain justifying their adventures in the eyes of the Crown.  This self-congratulating “culture of the &lt;em&gt;probanza&lt;/em&gt;” became the dominant discourse of the conquest, and, unfortunately, it still taints much of history.  Foreshadowing English penetrations into North America, conquistadores called their ventures “companies”&amp;nbsp;(35).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Myth of the White Conquistador must be dismantled, too.  While history tells “tales of barbarian hordes miraculously repulsed,” this too is a falsehood (44).  Certainly, small numbers of Spanish fighters were able to win many battles, but they did not do it alone.  The Spanish had an enormous number of Indian allies; one historian has estimated there were 200,000 Tlaxcalans with Cortes at Tenochtitlan (47).  But these warriors were not traitors—the Tlaxcalans pragmatically used the Spanish to help rout their own enemy.  Restall highlights that there were Africans with the conquistadores, as well.  Such as, Juan Valiente, a young West African man who had been enslaved and brought to the new world, where he convinced his owner to let him branch out on his own for four years.  Valiente went on Pedro de Alvarado’s campaign to Peru, and in doing so was able to procure his own&amp;nbsp;freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Myth of Completion is next. Cortés himself, past historians, and many present-day textbooks make it seem as though the Spanish merely had to enter Mexico and like magic it was conquered, all neat and tidy, by 1521.  Reality was infinitely more complicated.  Indians resisted in a variety of ways.  There was a great deal of intermittent armed resistance, and there were infinite varieties of everyday resistance.  Indigenous groups employed a strategy of mixed accommodation and resistance, and were never fully conquered in the way the Spanish imagined.   Native cultures persisted and native traditions endured, many to this&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Myth of (Mis)Communication is a dual myth.  On one hand, Cortes and historian William Prescott would have us believe that everyone understood each other perfectly.  But there is virtually no mention of interpreters in Cortes’ letters to the King—Malintzin is completely absent.  And let’s not forget the absurd &lt;em&gt;Requerimiento&lt;/em&gt;, read in Spanish before an attack, offering Indians the chance to submit to the rule of Spain and its Christian god.  It may as well have been gibberish.   Rituals for greetings and almost everything else were different amongst Mesoamerican peoples and Spaniards, and there was confusion about the meaning of gestures and words even with interpreters.  For example, when Cortes tried to hug Moctezuma, it was interpreted as an insult.  And perhaps it was… This is where things get really complicated.  It was, as James Lockhart puts it, a case of “Double Mistaken Identity,” where “each side of the cultural exchange presumes that a given form or concept is functioning in the way familiar within its own tradition and is unaware of or unimpressed by the other side’s interpretation” (76).  But while words and customs were certainly miscommunicated, Restall points out that the Spanish intent to take over came across quite&amp;nbsp;clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the Myth of Native Desolation and the Myth of Superiority.  Native cultures were not wholesale destroyed in an instant after 1521, and the European conquerors did not win territory because of any superiority, whether technological or cultural.  Since my undergrad degree is in cultural anthropology, a big part of my undergraduate education was devoted to exploring native cultures that have carried on, resisting and reinventing and persisting into our own era.  But the way that Restall synthesizes and explains this familiar ground is refreshing and brilliant.  I particularly appreciated his concise summary of pathogens’ impact upon indigenous America, and his sensitive portrayal of&amp;nbsp;Moctezuma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restall’s achievement in &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths &lt;/em&gt;is nothing short of brilliant.  After opening the book with a call to recognizing not just Spanish bias and agendas, but our own unconscious assumptions and the way that they shape how we perceive history, Restall delivers.  This is a fresh and gripping analysis of a history that we all &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; we are pretty familiar with.  But Restall unpacks our assumptions, and presents multiple voices from which we may attempt to glean the historical&amp;nbsp;truth.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;From the perspective of a person who is currently teaching the second half of the Western Civilizations class, Matthew Restall’s book &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest &lt;/em&gt;is quite useful.  I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that I am guilty to a certain degree of unwittingly perpetuating some of the myths that Restall debunks. The technology trap is perhaps the easiest to fall into.   True, the Spaniards and their allies from across the Atlantic had steel weapons, but these did not make or break the conquest.  The sheer number of indigenes recruited and used by the Spaniards belies the faith the Spanish had in their weapons.   The superiority myth also seems particularly difficult to eradicate.   I think every special (not that I watch these sorts of things regularly) on the History channel about the conquest represents Cortez as having been the fulfillment of some vague Aztec prophecy regarding the return of a god from across the sea. Though I’m pretty much eliminating the possibility of being able to do this for this particular class, his book in itself provides the foundation for a unit studying of the conquest in an undergraduate class and might be used as an inroad to helping students question similar&amp;nbsp;stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final item of interest is the admittedly old idea of creating myths to explain complex historical processes. This made me think of the most modern manifestation of  Meso-American mythos: The Mayan calendar and 2012.  I wonder how this fits into the picture of Restall’s&amp;nbsp;myths?&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;While this very well shows my age, the myths that Restall debunks in his 2003 study constituted the history taught to me during my time in high school in the 1980s.  During that period of my life, anytime the subject of the Spanish conquest of Mexico came up, my mind filled with images of a small group of bold, adventurous, and cruel Spanish soldiers fighting hordes of Aztecs en route to a quick and very bloody conquest of Montezuma&amp;#8217;s empire.  Luckily, having taken a few history courses since those days, my understanding of the Conquest has enlarged a bit, but not so much that Restall&amp;#8217;s book did not manage to surprise me from time to time.  Those surprises&amp;nbsp;included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Surprise #1, as shown in chapter one, Cortes&amp;#8217; campaigns followed standard conquest procedures as developed during previous campaigns in the Mediterranean and North Africa.  Cortes, far from being unique among Spanish conquerors, constituted one among many Spanish adventurers/conquerors who simply remained faithful to the tried-and-true rules of&amp;nbsp;conquest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Surprise #2, as shown in chapter three, the myth of the white conquistador should not have surprised me as much as it did, but the sheer numbers of Native Americans that participated at times in the Conquest shocked me.  Having some exposure to Native American histories in North America during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it should have occurred to me that the American Indian technique of using foreigners to aid them in fighting against their own Native enemies would know no geographic boundaries.  Alas, it did not, but thankfully Restall corrected my lack of historical&amp;nbsp;imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Surprise #3, as shown in chapter four, the &amp;#8220;myth of completion&amp;#8221; caught me off-guard as Restall shows that the conquistadors provided the illusion of success and completion to their conquests as a means of receiving royal-sponsored spoils.  However, that success and completion failed to materialize for many, many years to come.  And, in one particular case involving the Seminole Indians of Florida, completion never occurred for either Spain, or, technically, the United&amp;nbsp;States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vividly written as well as clear and thoughtful in its expression, Restall&amp;#8217;s study adds fascinating complexity to the previously conventional telling of the Spanish Conquest of Central and South America.  No longer the story of a few valiant Spanish soldiers&amp;#8217; daring, Restall offers a truer, more complex history of the Conquest that should serve as a starting point for all such histories to&amp;nbsp;come.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Having spent much of winter break surrounded by family members who think that being a historian merely entails the accumulation of facts about the perfectly knowable past, I opened Restall&amp;#8217;s book about common &amp;#8220;myths&amp;#8221; regarding the early Spanish experience in the Americas with glee.  Unfortunately, the book left me feeling disappointed and even a little hollow.  This is not to suggest that the book was bad, but rather that I did not find much illumination in it.  During the course of my education I have never received exposure to any of these seven &amp;#8220;myths,&amp;#8221; and was really unaware that there were in fact such common misconceptions.  This may be a credit to my high-school world history teacher, but I think rather that Restall has set up a bit of straw man (mostly in the form of the 1992 film &lt;em&gt;1492: Conquest of Paradise&lt;/em&gt;) so as to be able to go about debunking his&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;myths.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all of that, I did still find much of value in the book and found it an enjoyable read.  It certainly makes for a handy reintroduction to the topic as a means of preparing for our course.  I simply would have preferred a straight-forward approach and something aimed at a more scholarly audience than Restall seems to have had in&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;#8217;d like to say that historians should really follow Restall&amp;#8217;s lead in including student term papers in their&amp;nbsp;bibliographies.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span xmlns=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matthew Restall&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest&lt;/em&gt; seeks to correct traditional misconceptions regarding the Spanish conquest of the Americas. These myths were largely begun when the Conquistadors wrote their side of the story, often trying to explain objects and ideas for which they had no word. In addition, they had interest in self-promotion as did the larger Spanish Empire. These embellished truths became accepted by later generations of historians and still exist to some degree today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restall begins by dispelling the myth that the discovery and conquest were made possible by a few great men. In reality, Columbus was an unexceptional participant who did not even know where he had landed and Cortes merely one of many conquerors. Both had interest in promoting their own deeds, though Cortes was more successful in his lifetime. They were largely given credit when later generations venerated them for national pride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then tackles the myth that the Conquistadors were soldiers sent by Spain. In fact, Armies were a later creation and most Conquistadors were not conscripted but signed up in hope of future wealth and title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then challenges the myths that the Spanish conquered on their own and that the conquest was quick and complete. In reality, the Spanish played one Native American faction against another and used African slaves in their fighting. The myth of quick conquest was perpetuated by self-interest on a personal and national level. In reality, the conquest happened over centuries and was never complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next myth he examines is that communication between cultures was present, a myth perpetuated by the Spanish in part to justify their claims. He also examines the counter-myth that later developed that claimed communication was non-existence. Restall argues for a middle ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then dispels the myth that the Native population was wiped out. In fact, after the initial decline, due chiefly to disease, the population began to slowly increase and Native culture was never actually threatened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final chapter addresses the myth of Spanish superiority, the culmination of the other myths. Instead, Restall attributes Spanish successes to disease, native disunity, superior weaponry (primarily swords), the fact that the Spanish ignored conventions of war that the Natives kept, and the process of globalization that temporarily gave the Spanish the advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restall draws upon multiple sources, from primary accounts and traditional histories to comic books and movies. The book is well-written and the arguments convincing, though it seems a tragedy they need to be made. In the end, &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates that history is much more complicated than any single source can convey and that every side of the story must be considered or half-truths become accepted myths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My personal reactions: As much as I&amp;#8217;d like to say I&amp;#8217;ve never bought into any of these myths, they were largely assumed in any history class I had prior to my undergraduate years. Since my first &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; History class as an undergraduate, I&amp;#8217;ve never bought into the myth of Western superiority, which is the central myth Restall attempts to debunk. It&amp;#8217;s just nice to have additional arguments for my beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book also raises questions about the use of sources and historical memory. What are the problems inherent in the use of primary sources? What are the processes by which a partial telling of an event becomes accepted truth? How are we to ever know if what we believe to be fact is true? Restall might have spent some time opining on the questions he obliquely raised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a link to the theme song from &lt;em&gt;1492: Conquest of Paradise&lt;/em&gt;, the movie often cited in the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeDsa4Tw0c&#34;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeDsa4Tw0c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-3263456164355985970?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <id>/history561/posts/a-few-thoughts-on-restalle28099s-e2809cseven-mythse2809d.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;As a rule, I avoid using the word &amp;#8220;fun&amp;#8221; as an adjective, but Matthew Restall&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest&lt;/em&gt; stikes me as a wothwhile exception. It is, indeed, a fun read, the sort of book one can read without a pencil, under a tree (assuming people ever do that anymore).  Restall&amp;#8217;s style is clear and straightforward, and the sheer amount of detail contained in this brief volume only reinforces, in my mind, what I am coming to accept as a truism&amp;#8211;that the writing of a short book takes more skill than a lengthy one. This, combined with Restall&amp;#8217;s thorough knowledge of the historical period as well as treasure-trove of secondary literature (including authors I would not normally expect to encounter in an academic volume, such as Nobel Laureate Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio) allows the book a usefulness in a variety of classroom settings. (More on that at the&amp;nbsp;end.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests, Restall&amp;#8217;s approach is thematic, which not only works well for deconstructing the various myths of the Conquest, but also, in one or two instances&amp;#8211;I might as well be honest&amp;#8211;reminding the reader what those myths were in the first place. (I am thinking, specifically, of chapters 5 and 6.) For example, while I was aware that the Aztecs (Mexica? Is one term more apropriate than the other? Restall never says.) did not consider the Spaniards to be gods, and that the majority of conquerors were not &amp;#8220;soldiers&amp;#8221; in the nation-state sense of the word, I was surprised at the sheer number of natives who assisted the Spaniards, and had been unaware of the exact role  played by the Spanish monarchy in the transatlantic&amp;nbsp;voyages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two petty comments: One, I was mildly pleased with Restall&amp;#8217;s obvious scorn for the accrued myths surrounding the figure of Christopher Columbus, the inteligent navigator and, apparently, compulsive liar. While Restall makes it clear that attempting to discern Colubus&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;true&amp;#8221; motives is a risky endeavor, he at least introduces the question: Did Columbus really die believing he had found the East Indies, or did he stubbornly cling to his story in theface is overwhelming evidence to the contrary? Second, I must say it was refreshing to see a scholar of the Conquest criticize portions of Jared Diamond&amp;#8217;s mega-bestselling &lt;em&gt;Guns, Germs, and Steel &lt;/em&gt;for&lt;em&gt; un&lt;/em&gt;critically accepting various myths of the Conquest as  fact, and then incorporating them into his&amp;nbsp;thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More important, however, is the fact that Restall&amp;#8217;s work makes one think about larger issues, which is all I ask of any book. In particular, he mentions that the term &amp;#8220;Conquest&amp;#8221; itself implies, at least implicitly, that the Native Americans were, from the moment of first contact, on the side of a losing proposition. Phrased another way, &amp;#8220;the Spanish Conquest,&amp;#8221; rather than &amp;#8220;Spanish-Aztec War,&amp;#8221; perhaps unwittingly leads us to read history in retrospect, rather than in prospect. Restall reminds us that the Spanish landfall on Mexican soil did not lead, inevitably, to the Spanish Conquest of Mexico. Another example is Restall&amp;#8217;s emphasis on the conquerors&amp;#8217; phrasing of the Maya &amp;#8220;rebellion&amp;#8221; of the 1540s, when the Conquest was by no means complete. By claiming the Conquest complete, and successful, the Spaniards could claim the Maya were engaged not in a war to maintain their independence, but in an illegal revolt against the legal government. In short, how we define people&amp;#8211;or a people&amp;#8211;dictates how we treat&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say, I find the question of when, exactly, the Conquest ended to be of particular fascination. Was it the moment when Cortes died, or when, in the early nineteenth century, the Latin American Republics fought for and achieved their independence from Spain? Restall, wisely I think, offers no answers of his own, but allows the questions tostand as fodder for further thought. I must say, as one whose primary focus of study is the political and diplomatic history of the United States in the early nineteenth century, I found Restall&amp;#8217;s suggestion (on page 72) that the bloody Seminole War in Spanish Florida was a direct continuation of the Conquest to be one of the more eye-opening sentences I have read in a while, one that, I hope, will enable me to more effectively examine, and teach, both American and world&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I see Restall&amp;#8217;s work as essential reading on this topic of the Conquest, one that deserves to be read and reread. As I have yet to encounter a world history textbook I like, and yet I see the urgent need for well-crafted world history courses for undergraduate surveys, I believe &lt;em&gt;Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest &lt;/em&gt;will make an excellent, (and, frankly, low-cost)&amp;nbsp;alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Beginning Steps for&amp;nbsp;Zotero&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download and install Firefox (http://www.mozilla.com/en-&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;/firefox/personal.html), if you don’t already have it
Download and install the Zotero 2.0 beta plug-in for Firefox (http://www.zotero.org). &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;N.B.&lt;/span&gt; You must use the 2.0 beta plug-in. I have been using this plug-in for months and have had no stability issues whatsoever.
Watch the video explaining Zotero at http://www.zotero.org.
Register for a Zotero account at https://www.zotero.org/user/register/.
Join our class group at http://www.zotero.org/groups/reading_technology_english_465.
Connect your browser’s installation of Zotero to your account, as directed at http://www.zotero.org/support/sync.

                                &lt;p&gt;The first thing we must do this semester is set each of you up with your own blog. It&amp;#8217;s very easy to do. There are many free blogging services out there, the two most popular being &lt;a href=&#34;blogger.com/start&#34;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Wordpress.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, what is a blog anyway?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;object width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;344&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/NN2I1pWXjXI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/NN2I1pWXjXI&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;344&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will your &amp;#8220;news&amp;#8221; stories be? Well, they will be summaries, reactions, and critiques to our weekly readings, lectures, and discussions. Your blog is your own personal space on the web in which to interact with this class. Of course, it is also a public space. Everything you publish on your site will be fed directly onto this one, and also available to the world. Keep that in mind as you write. Your audience is me, as your professor, but also your colleagues in class and anyone else who might stumble upon your humble corner of the&amp;nbsp;internets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to begin? Well, Wordpress.com has simple instructions for registering your own blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.support.wordpress.com/getting-started/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.support.wordpress.com/introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also start with the how-to video from &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.tv/?s=wordpress.com&#34;&gt;wordpress.tv&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;embed src=&#34;http://v.wordpress.com/wp-content/plugins/video/flvplayer.swf?ver=1.15&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; flashvars=&#34;guid=wahd1Gdg&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;height=360&amp;amp;qc_publisherId=p-18-mFEk4J448M&#34; title=&#34;Signing up with WordPress.com&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve registered a blog, make sure to email me with your name, your blog&amp;#8217;s name, and its url (that&amp;#8217;s the blog&amp;#8217;s web address). Once you&amp;#8217;ve done that, feel free to customize your space anyway you&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;like.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been derelict on the blog the last few months. This semester has been my first as a full time commuter, flying most weeks back and forth between the South and the Southwest. I also taught an overload, banking a course for some future research and writing time. Along the way, my manuscript was accepted [&amp;#8230;]&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=parezcoydigo.wordpress.com&amp;blog=3594723&amp;post=295&amp;subd=parezcoydigo&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>
