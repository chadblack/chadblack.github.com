<p><span xmlns=""> <p>Matthew Restall&#8217;s <em>Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest</em> seeks to correct traditional misconceptions regarding the Spanish conquest of the Americas. These myths were largely begun when the Conquistadors wrote their side of the story, often trying to explain objects and ideas for which they had no word. In addition, they had interest in self-promotion as did the larger Spanish Empire. These embellished truths became accepted by later generations of historians and still exist to some degree today.<br /></p><p> </p><p>Restall begins by dispelling the myth that the discovery and conquest were made possible by a few great men. In reality, Columbus was an unexceptional participant who did not even know where he had landed and Cortes merely one of many conquerors. Both had interest in promoting their own deeds, though Cortes was more successful in his lifetime. They were largely given credit when later generations venerated them for national pride.<br /></p><p>He then tackles the myth that the Conquistadors were soldiers sent by Spain. In fact, Armies were a later creation and most Conquistadors were not conscripted but signed up in hope of future wealth and title.<br /></p><p>He then challenges the myths that the Spanish conquered on their own and that the conquest was quick and complete. In reality, the Spanish played one Native American faction against another and used African slaves in their fighting. The myth of quick conquest was perpetuated by self-interest on a personal and national level. In reality, the conquest happened over centuries and was never complete.<br /></p><p>The next myth he examines is that communication between cultures was present, a myth perpetuated by the Spanish in part to justify their claims. He also examines the counter-myth that later developed that claimed communication was non-existence. Restall argues for a middle ground.<br /></p><p>He then dispels the myth that the Native population was wiped out. In fact, after the initial decline, due chiefly to disease, the population began to slowly increase and Native culture was never actually threatened.<br /></p><p>The final chapter addresses the myth of Spanish superiority, the culmination of the other myths. Instead, Restall attributes Spanish successes to disease, native disunity, superior weaponry (primarily swords), the fact that the Spanish ignored conventions of war that the Natives kept, and the process of globalization that temporarily gave the Spanish the advantage.<br /></p><p>Restall draws upon multiple sources, from primary accounts and traditional histories to comic books and movies. The book is well-written and the arguments convincing, though it seems a tragedy they need to be made. In the end, <em>Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest</em> demonstrates that history is much more complicated than any single source can convey and that every side of the story must be considered or half-truths become accepted myths.<br /></p><p>My personal reactions: As much as I&#8217;d like to say I&#8217;ve never bought into any of these myths, they were largely assumed in any history class I had prior to my undergraduate years. Since my first <span class="caps">US</span> History class as an undergraduate, I&#8217;ve never bought into the myth of Western superiority, which is the central myth Restall attempts to debunk. It&#8217;s just nice to have additional arguments for my beliefs.<br /></p><p>The book also raises questions about the use of sources and historical memory. What are the problems inherent in the use of primary sources? What are the processes by which a partial telling of an event becomes accepted truth? How are we to ever know if what we believe to be fact is true? Restall might have spent some time opining on the questions he obliquely raised.<br /></p><p>Lastly, a link to the theme song from <em>1492: Conquest of Paradise</em>, the movie often cited in the book.<br /></p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeDsa4Tw0c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYeDsa4Tw0c</a><br /></p></span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6129607730141858608-3263456164355985970?l=georgeuriah561.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article></article>
