<!--StartFragment-->  <br /><div class="MsoNormal">“Historical methodology, as I see it, is a product of common sense applied to circumstances.”</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">This week I took a step back and decided to investigate where I get my information from. I decided to really watch if I get information from the Internet. It turns out I get a lot more from the Internet than I even thought. It may not seem like receiving information but the H-Net emails I receive information from to the Public History news I look up are all receiving information. I also tend to look at the news in a one sided way. So I have decided to try and make myself more informed on an unbiased way. But, as we have learned in this class this is harder than it seems. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Methodology is defined as a set or system of methods, principles, and rules for regulating a given discipline, as in the arts or sciences. Methodology is one of the hardest terms that we have to define. Historical methodology is the guidelines by which historians use primary resources and research to form their papers. In class we talked about what makes up this complicated term. The best way to understand why and how historians form this was through the example in class of what makes historians. How it is a training process. One of the most important parts of this was the language and how when reading a primary document it should be not be transparent. It should not be something that is looked over. The language that is used can give an insight to the reader about the time and the way that they viewed what was going on. In class we talked about how hermeneutics played into this. When using hermeneutics the reader is able to define the intent of the document to its most basic intent. The reader is able to see how the document would have been able to be read at the time. This is very important when doing research and basing an argument on this. Because if you do research and base the subject of your argument on documents. Then if you do not understand the point of the document than your argument will be lost. You may totally miss what the writer of the document was trying to say. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I feel this is when ethnohistory becomes so important. Even when using oral histories, which are so important to this method of history, you have to put yourself into that situation. Saying that language is not transparent is the same thing as saying that culture is not transparent. If you look over a culture and just compare it to whatever is familiar to you, than you will lose the complete reason for the ethnohistory. That is why it was so hard for them to define because until the late 1980s early 1990s this ethnocentrism could not be shaken off. That is why personal views play so much into history. True ethnohistory could not be done until the shackles of the past ignorance had been shaken. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In the article written by Valentina Tikoff, she had to put herself in the time and read the situation differently than it had before. The situation at the orphanages had only been read through the court documents. But now she was reading the registers for orphanages. By doing this she had to learn the language and the vocabulary of what would be in there. She also had to explain this in her writing so that her argument would be even stronger. She had to explain the difference between a Foundling and an orphan. She also had to be able to explain the different kind of orphans that were there. To explain the people that was paying to go there. By using methodology she was able to do this and her argument that orphanages were not just being used in the literal sense.&nbsp;</div><!--EndFragment--><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2167849845721184365-3344104306990503024?l=matteavs.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></article>			</div>
