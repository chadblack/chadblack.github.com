<!--StartFragment-->  <br /><div class="MsoNormal">Jorge de Alvarado’s account</div><div class="MsoNormal">Pg. 55-59</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">His account presents a differing point of view than his cousin Gonzalo de Alvarado. He discusses his campaign of 1527 to 1529 in which led to the Spanish colony in Guatemala. This letter was to the King, written on February 26, 1534. This letter is asking for the King of Spain to make Jorge de Alvarado the governor of the provinces of Guatemala that he states he conquered and pacified. Alvarado uses many routes to show how he deserves this appointment especially over his brother. He first tries to correct the wrongdoing that has occurred in the credit of the conquering of Guatemala. He does this by explaining how he was actually the one to conquer and pacify the land. He then explains how he did this with much personal expense to himself. He also is very careful to show that this conquering was not a simple task, but came at much personal hardship. He explains how they did not just walk away easily but had to be very persistent with the natives. He uses rhetoric that makes sure to sound that he is the only one that was ever able to pacify Guatemala. That no one had been able to do it before, and he went in heroically and saved the day. It is also very evident that Jorge is writing persuasively to the king. He uses vocabulary that evokes his honoring and humbleness to the king. He says “Your Holy Majesty” and “kisses your royal feet.” The reader can feel his desperation to receive what he deserves is his. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The letter comes at a very important time in both the lives of Pedro and Jorge de Alvarado. Pedro would come back from his expedition from Peru in a year. Jorge knew that he had a very small window to explain to the king why Pedro should not receive the governorship at his return. He wanted to explain everything he had been able to do in Pedro’s absence. But, he also knew that the state of Guatemala on his arrival in 1527 would not be known to anyone but himself. This was the weakness of his letter is that to a King half a world away, it could not be explained the depth of the change that Jorge had on Guatemala. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">This letter is very important for the historical interpretation of the conquering of Guatemala. Before 2004 it was an ingrained fact that Pedro de Alvarado was the conqueror and settler of Guatemala. But, through the publication of the Jorge’s letter in 2004 it helped to explain his side of the story. This version is also very important because this is the first time it is being published in English. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Because of the context this source is very important for not just verifying to the King who is responsible for conquering Guatemala, but also to history. Jorge had insight and was able to see that his brother once returned would receive credit for what he had done. He wrote this letter to first receive politically what he felt he deserved but also historically. Unfortunately, because of Pedro’s connections he was able to leave history with a more impactful legacy. This source is incredibly important to unearthing what the true history of the conquering of Guatemala was. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;Till next week,&nbsp;</o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">matteavs</div><!--EndFragment--><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2167849845721184365-6498238354871906723?l=matteavs.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></article>			</div>
