<!--StartFragment-->  <br /><div class="MsoNormal">Merriam Webster defines a method as “a procedure or process for attaining an object.” Before this week it was very hard to see how we take use the steps involved in methodology and form them into a coherent argument; even further into a finished product of a paper. This week the concepts of methodology were put into a coherent set of steps. Through this process the object of creating a paper can be accomplished. Any of the pieces seperatly do not result in a solid paper, but all together they do. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In the two articles that I read for this week they were both done through a local approach. The first article by Sundiata Cha-Jua was about the northern town of Decatur, Illinois from 1894 to 1898. She is making an argument about the situation of lynching and racial mob violence throughout the north by concentrating on this small town. By discussing the events in the town of Decatur the author makes a statement about the racial problems in small towns while at the same time discussing it on a national level. This article sets itself apart from the other because it uses the local aspect to go along with what is going on nationally. She is also able through her article to understand why some lynching’s were prevented by a mob of African-Americans and some were not. The first lynching she discusses of Samuel J. Bush was not prevented because he was not a local. He had just been passing through. Also this was a town that had not seen much racial violence if any so the fact that a man was being lynched was very strange. The second potential lynching of James Jackson was stopped by a mob that made sure he was protected. Another characteristic part of the article was the author’s use of secondary source concepts that help to define the terms of what was going on in this small town. One example of this is Craig Calhoun’s concept of community, density, and multiplicity. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The second article was much different because it did not mention anything at a global level at all. But, by talking in depth on a local level the author is also making a statement about the global world also. In class we learned that there can be terms other than global and local. There is the individual speaking generally about a group. This article uses this a lot because it goes in depth about certain individuals to speak generally about a whole group. This article by Sharon Farmer is speaking about the population of immigrants to the town of St Dennis and their use of the tomb of Louis <span class="caps">IX</span> who was soon-to-be canonized. The source is very significant because it is taken from one set of stories from the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Miracle of Saint Louis</i>. The author speaks specifically about the women and their individual agency. She makes a line between women who are married and women who are single. Because it has been thought that the women who are married had more advantages. But, they actually did not. If they were sick they were forced to beg on the streets, while still caring for their famalies. But, what is significant is the towns the sense of community that was created. Neighbors would go to help women who they had heard were healed. Also, if a single woman was in need there were women who could help her. The other part of the article that is significant is her use of microhistory. This was a term that I was not familiar with. Through her use of this one source she is able to make an assessment of women’s lives who are on the bottom of society. Further making an argument for all immigrant women in Paris and throughout the country. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Till next week, </div><div class="MsoNormal">matteavs</div><!--EndFragment--><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2167849845721184365-2365194936396144550?l=matteavs.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></article>			</div>
