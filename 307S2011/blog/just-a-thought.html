<!--StartFragment-->  <br /><div class="MsoNormal">For my blog this week I am going to stray away from the norm of describing what we have discussed in class and making commentary on it. Instead I would like to talk about what I took from the reading last week. I will first give a little insight into my thoughts on the Remains vs. sources debate but I would like to go into other items that I took from “Reading Primary Sources.” Firstly, I think it would be very hard if in research you were stuck strictly with sources. If that were your area of study such as intellectual history that we discussed in class it would be very efficient. But, in my mind it could cloud the factual history that we are trying to construct. But, on the other hand just because a primary document is found that was never intended to be read does not mean it is not void of biases. But, maybe even further what is important is that whether it is remains or a source when reading the primary source we can take away what the perspective was at that time pertaining what we are researching. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>“For him, disclosing the historical ideas behind past events enabled one to develop a sense of the general structure of history.”</b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">One interesting part in part 1 that contrasted with Droysen’s theories on remains and sources was Ranke’s theories on historical criticism. He believed that the true facts of history could only come by a historian using intensive assessment of the historical sources. Through this historians can detect historical changes and the subjective becomes the objective. What became most important about this section was neither Ranke or Droysen but the fact that by accepting the usefulness of constructing past events through primary documents it meant a huge change in historiography. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">When reading the sections that concerned different types of primary documents different ways that certain kinds of documents could become useful occurred to me. During the letter section of the book one of the most interesting parts was how letters can reveal characteristics about people that without the document would become unknown. One example of this demographic is the poor and powerless. As more people became literate more people wrote letters that expressed their views on their situations. These letters could reveal much to a person researching. I think another very important part of the letter section that had never occurred to me was letters of citizenship. One letter that has been used from Ken Burns to Douglass Southall Freeman is the story of a girl who sent a letter to Abraham Lincoln telling him to grow a beard so that he could win the election. This is a very famous letter that shows the love of Lincoln that this little girl inhibits. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In the memoranda section there was a concept that I would like to dwell on that I am wondering if could be used in other areas of primary document and that is the concept of a ‘think piece.’ This idea is to say that they are studying a political decision and find a memo that would have been the turning point of that decision. Now this would be very hard to find but it is out there. This is the point of studying memoranda is to find out the complexities of the backgrounds of the political decisions that were made. Maybe the decision is not what it seems on the surface. There could be clues about the aggression of the decision. I am wondering if this could be found in letters and diaries. Maybe there is a think piece in a diary that explains why a person made the decision they did. Just an insight. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Till next week, </div><div class="MsoNormal">matteavs</div><!--EndFragment--><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2167849845721184365-7873707520287990142?l=matteavs.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></article>			</div>
