<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So I thought I would write a bit about each of the chapters I read on primary sources for this past week: letters, newspapers, and court files. &nbsp;First off, court files document by what standards people in the past were judged and how people interacted with these standards. &nbsp;As an historian, when working with court files it is important to recognize that they contain a multiplicity of content (i.e. interrogations, testimonies, verdicts). &nbsp;While this certainly gives the researcher a plethora of potential information, often the varying accounts can be riddled with conscious distortions of the truth. &nbsp;Beyond this, the book lays out three key concepts to consider when using court files as primary sources. &nbsp;First, one must remember the dialogical nature of court files &#8212; usually the documents are a compilation of multiple perspectives. &nbsp;Moreover, it is critical to consider the files&#8217; emplotment: under what circumstances led to the court files&#8217; creation? &nbsp;Lastly, the nature of court files presupposes an underlying cultural context, as one can catch a glimpse of what people in the past considered normal behavior. &nbsp;Working with Constitutionalism as a topic I feel like I will be reading many, many court files as I move forward. &nbsp;In fact, the article I read for the paper on methodology employed court files successfully in showing how certain cases increased the governmentâ€™s role within the American economy, albeit Constitutional limitations.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next primary source I read about was newspapers, as I unintelligibly discussed in class. &nbsp;Newspapers are distinguishable sources largely because they filter through raw news and cover only the most contemporary issues. &nbsp;Additionally, newspapers stand out as a source because they rely on paid advertisements to survive, providing advertisers with de facto licensing power. &nbsp;Clearly, one has to consider this along with other elements of the paper&#8217;s institutional framework to determine if newspapers are source-worthy. &nbsp;For instance, who really controls the paper: the editorial staff or the paying advertisers? &nbsp;Another factor to reflect on is the visual context and overall editorial decisions that contributed to the newspapers&#8217; production. &nbsp;It makes quite a bit of difference in knowing whether an article was a front page piece or simply shoved somewhere along the inner pages of the newspaper. &nbsp;Lastly, a potential researcher would also want to review the textual context of the piece. &nbsp;At times the author&#8217;s tone, narrative voice, and sources used can help you determine if the newspaper is a credible source. &nbsp;Clearly, newspapers are a tricky source to use effectively as they can be hard to analyze and have a great many prospective downfalls.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Last but not least I also wanted to read the section covering letters as primary sources. &nbsp;As the book discusses briefly, it is interesting to contemplate how the use of letters in writing great man history was a precursor to its extensive use in writing histories from below. &nbsp;Letter writing is a relational process as one learns about both the author and the intended reader in accessing the personal life of the correspondents. &nbsp;However, personal letters exist alongside more official letters, perhaps between a citizen and their governing body. &nbsp;Obviously I feel like I would be working more with official letters while composing a political history versus a social one. &nbsp;There are a few things that affect the way a letter writer articulates his/her thoughts, slightly limiting the reader&#8217;s window into the author&#8217;s views. &nbsp;For one, conventions of letter writing constrain the author into pre-conceived formalities of letter composition. &nbsp;Moreover, the authors words are molded by what they think the letter recipient expects. &nbsp;However, in the end it seemed to me like the book offered letters as one of the better sources, at least in evaluating the mindset of an individual author.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On another note, I love the sheer amount of directories provided by<i> The Information-Literate Historian</i>. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve played around on a couple of the government documents directories, but didn&#8217;t spend enough time on them to find anything too cool..<br /><div><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6064731372720731332-5045879521729698138?l=zfullert.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
