<!--StartFragment-->  <br /><div class="MsoNormal">The articles this week are teaching us about archiving and the very important positives and negatives that can come from trying to save our precious historical resources. The first article by Louis Bickford, discussed the preservation of documents relating to human rights injustices in the Southern Cone of Latin America. These documents specifically ones produced by HRNGOs stand in grave danger of being reduced to dust because of improper treatment of these documents. One argument for why this has occurred is because there has not been enough time to pass for the country to really realize the importance of discussing nationally what atrocities have occurred in their country. They give a prime example that it took almost a hundred years before the United States could really discuss its activity in the transatlantic slave trade. One of the biggest dangers that makes the documentation that they do have so important is that many documents were destroyed to try to cover up what has occurred. This is inherent in nations wanting to manipulate their past’s history. Stemming from some nation’s do not want their archives of human rights problems to become available because they know people will research it and find out about it. Also the historiography on that subject matter will expand internationally. Within this there are two camps that have developed on who stress remembering the other who advocate forgetting. These arguments are not new in the study of history. These arguments about the importance of remembering history have come up in a number of dialogues. One part of this facing the development of these archives is budgets. If these government believe that they should leave their pasts behind, they are not going to fund projects that support the progression of the remembrance of their past. There have been strides made in these countries to try to gather these materials but have fallen short in preservation. One discussion that has come up a number of times this semester is privatization. Just because it needs to be kept private does not mean it should not be preserved. It still could tell us something in the future. Another discussion is releasing these documents to libraries and archives in other countries. Some are very unwilling to do this and will be a time limit on when they can have them available. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I have always been very against using online archives as a major resource for primary research. But, after looking at these websites I am convinced that it is a positive move not just for preservation but also for the berth of information that we can get now with archives being on a website. On the National Security Archive the Chiquita papers intrigued me. I was so impressed how looking at the copy on the website was pretty close to having that document in your hand. What made them even more useful than even being at the archive was that it gave a lot of background information on the individual archives. This made them even more powerful. I have seen on other websites how works that have to be transcribed are already done for you such as with the Lincoln Papers at the Library Congress where 20,000 of Lincoln’s papers were transcribed and digitized. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-fareast-font-family: Cambria; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">The next article “Scan this Book!” reveals the impact of digitizing books. This was a startling article because I had not thought about how far this could go in a number of years. Kevin Kelly compares the potential wealth that will be in a digital archive to the library at Alexandria. One of the impacts that he says is that no book will be an island. No book is isolated in itself. Especially with a search engine, before a person had to do the legwork to the see the pertinence of a book. Now they can have a search that picks what is pertinent for them. This will also help people to pull sections from different books. Books will no longer be complete entities in themselves. They will be mixed with other books to create interwebs. A couple positive changes that Kelly makes is that one it will increase readership especially on items with very few readership at the moment. The feeling of completeness and authority over having it all in one place will increase. For me I see the importance of works being on the computer but I am partial&nbsp;to pen and paper.</span><!--EndFragment--><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Cambria;"><br /></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Cambria;">Till next week,&nbsp;</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Cambria;">matteavs</span><br /><!--StartFragment--><span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-fareast-font-family: Cambria; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">&nbsp;</span><!--EndFragment--><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2167849845721184365-8158474682814198297?l=matteavs.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></article>			</div>
