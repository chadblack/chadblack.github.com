<p><em>Limits of Gender Domination: Women, Law, and Political Crisis in Quito,
1765-1830</em>. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2010.</p>
<p>Through analysis of extensive civil and criminal litigation, this book
documents impressive economic, legal, and social rights customarily
exercised by women of the <em>corregimiento</em> of Quito during the closing
decades of Bourbon rule. Following the cultural logic of decentralism
and negotiated consent, women were able to mitigate attempts by the
centralizing Bourbon state to control their bodies and discourage access
to legal resources. The narrative then analyzes the subsequent
dismantling of customary legal rights with the emergence of a stricter,
more hierarchical gender regime with the shift to a contract society
through Ecuador's experience of the Atlantic liberal revolution. On a
scholarly level, the book represents a significant revision of
late-colonial and early republican gender history. It is also filled
with compelling human stories drawn from the litigation pursued in the
barrios of Quito.</p>
