<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3> 
<p>I was first introduced to the notion of Spanish bureaucratic decentralism through John Leddy Phelan&#8217;s classic essay, &#8220;Authority and Flexibility in the Spanish Imperial Bureaucracy.&#8221;<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a>  It was also the article that first introduced me to the semantic formalization of decentralized rule in the phrase &#8220;I obey but do not execute.&#8221;<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a> The Spanish terms underlying the formula are <em>obedecer</em>, to obey, and <em>cumplir</em>, a term that can be variously translated as to comply, accomplish, execute, fulfill, satisfy, and also to obey. I like that obeying without obedience.  According to Phelan, the phrase exemplifies the logic and flexibility underlying the Spanish imperial system by maintaining fidelity to royal authority through intentional acts of intransigence. As Phelan explains, &#8220;Presiding magistrates in the Indies were permitted by law to postpone the execution of royal orders whose implementation might create an injustice or undesirable social conflicts.&#8221;<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a> Of course, as Phelan points out there were limits to invoking the formula, and any magistrate in royal service faced a judicial inquiry at the end of his term in the form of a <em>residencia</em>, and in the shorter term risked the ire of the Council of the Indies.  </p> 
<p>Phelan was not the first, nor the last, to document decentralization as the foundation of Spanish imperial rule in the Americas. Haring recognized it in <em>The Spanish Empire in America</em> back in the 1940s, and it was a hallmark of institutional histories of the empire. More recently, my panel colleague Alejandro Cañeque investigated the contingent nature of viceregal authority in New Spain, and the Hispanic American Historical Review recently ran a special issue on fiscal decentralization. And, despite an earlier reticence of scholars of the peninsula to reckon with the distance between royal rhetoric of absolute authority and the reality of royal authority, as Allyson Poska mentions in her paper, a growing body of early modern Spanish literature reckons with decentralism and negotiation as well.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a> As one would expect, the majority of this work engages decentralism through political, legal, and fiscal histories, institutional histories as it were, new and old. Certainly this makes sense given that the formal manifestation of decentralism is institutional, or rather exists at the institutional interface of magistrates, supplicants, and councilor officials and their ecclesiastical parallels. In part due to my training, and in part due to my own exposure to thousands of criminal and civil litigations, I have suspicions that the logic behind decentralism on the institutional level represents a mediating logic of early modern Spanish authority. My dissertation advisor, Kimberly Guarderman, wrote a book that argues that 17th century family relations were defined by the same logic of decentralism that mitigated the royal authority of the father king.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a> My first book extends this argument into the 18th-c. by documenting the extensive unlicensed use of the legal system, a phenomenon predicated on legal fictions in operation that amount to an obedience without compliance to the codes of Castile, the Indies, and the Siete Partidas.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a> </p> 
<p>What I&#8217;d like to discuss today extends this notion further by going into a single prosecution of adultery to argue that legal actions against sexual crimes in the 18th century provide evidence for a cultural logic analogous to the decentralized and negotiated consent of Spanish imperial politics and law. With the recent publication of Stuart Schwartz&#8217;s <em>All Can be Saved</em>, I think we have an analogous argument in the religious realm for what I keep finding with popular sexual practice&#8211; that of a pervasive tolerance of sexual acts that fall outside of prescriptive norms, such that those prescriptive norms must be questioned as truly normative. To paraphrase the title of a recent book, in the case of sexuality (at least in the 18th century) what we find is toleration without tolerance.<a href="#fn:fn1" id="fnref:fn1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a>Whereas the absolute authority of the king or viceroy played the role of prescriptive norm in the realm of political decentralization (and is still frequently accepted by our modernist colleagues as actually normative), in the sexual realm it&#8217;s still that bête noir of the Mediterranean honor code and its penetration-protecting-patriarchs that constrains the analysis. Interestingly, the main challenge to the Med. honor code has come from scholars of the peninsula.<a href="#fn:fn2" id="fnref:fn2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a> Nonetheless, is there an argument to be made that the tolerance of illicit sex is a manifestation of the same cultural logics that privileged legal, political, and economic decentralism? After reading thousands of cases of sexual crime, I would argue yes. To answer that question more fully, I should probably talk about about what the logic of negotiated consent signifies and how it is an analogue to toleration. </p> 
<p>I was recently reading Nitzan and Bichler’s <em>Capital as Power</em>, where they defined power as: “confidence in obedience. [Power] expresses the certainty of the rulers in the submissiveness of the ruled.”<a href="#fn:fn3" id="fnref:fn3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a> The Early Latin Americanist in me likes this definition.  Nitzan and Bichler connect the confidence in obedience to a capacity and willingness of rulers to “actively shape their society.”<a href="#fn:fn4" id="fnref:fn4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">10</a> Now, here we have a bit of a problem because of the slipperiness of the terms obedience and submission in the context of the Spanish empire which gave primacy to negotiated consent, customary practice, and some notion of community benefit over absolute compliance with royal orders. The legitimacy of royal authority rested on the maintenance of a tension between local expectations and practices, and royal desires to actively shape society. On the rhetorical level, fealty to the crown frequently recognized royal claims to absolute authority while simultaneously refusing it. The two weren’t mutually exclusively. (One is reminded of the contradictory impulses of that late 18th-c. battle cry, “Long live the King, and death to bad government!”) Under the Bourbons, the balance in this tension was increasingly broken by an interventionist state that took its claims to centralized authority seriously and personally. This impinged upon the social contract of obedience that demanded the crown recognize local practice (custom, derecho vulgar) almost above all else. The so-called Bourbon reforms were, above all else, a move against custom and local practice. And, it is really through the resulting crisis of authority that we can measure the extent to which decentralism, negotiation, and custom were deeply held cultural values. Not insignificantly, the frontal assault on the architecture of decentralism included an attack on lax sexual morality, resulting in an avalanche of sexual crime litigation. This litigation allows us to catch glimpses the countervailing popular sexual norms that were under attack by the centralizing Bourbon state.  These “norms” are important because they represent the custom and practice of sexual behavior that was long tolerated, even if not accepted in the barrios of Quito. And that slippage, between local sexual practice and central church-state dictates is where the same cultural logic of authority manifested itself. So today, I’d like take us through one such case that is illustrative of the trends I repeatedly find.</p> 
<hr /> 
<h3 id="alexofranciscayxavier">Alexo, Francisca, y Xavier</h3> 
<p>On the 20th of April, 1770 sombrerero filed a plaintive petition with a city magistrate in Quito protesting that his wife had abandoned her spousal obligations for more than fifteen years on account of her “notorious adultery and daring haughtiness.”<a href="#fn:fn5" id="fnref:fn5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">11</a> Merino claimed the the proof of Francisca’s infidelities stretched back thirteen years, to the first time she was caught by the the ronda cavorting publicly with her lover, a soldier named Xavier Sandoya. Francisca and Xavier were found together in one of the city’s shops by a municipal magistrate. Merino claimed that while she was in custody he had a Jesuit Father visit her to educate her and council her on her responsibilities to return to married life. As if to highlight her questionable character, Merino continually referred to his wife by her alias, La Xarra (literally jug, or pitcher). Certainly only shady figures of dubious morals and intentions go by aliases. Apparently la Xarra’s haughty pride and disregard for either husband or reputation was not easily chastised, and she was caught again by the ronda in the early 1760s, and she was again held in the women’s jail at the Recogimiento de Santa Marta. This time, Alexo Merino enlisted the intervention of two Jesuit priests and the President of the Audiencia to have his wife’s lover banished to the port city of Guayaquil.</p> 
<p>In response to his wife’s incorrigible behavior, Merino claimed he repeatedly sought judicial recourse before the bishop, fruitlessly requesting a formal separation of the marriage. Furthering his disgust, Merino reported his wife had given her lover 300 pesos to fund his removal to Guayaquil and his eventual return. Nothing, it seemed, could discourage his wife’s iniquities. Finally in April 1770, she found herself again in Santa Marta, placed there by the magistrate of the parishes of San Blas and Santa Barbara, whom Merino alleged la Xarra had tried to bribe with an offer of 500 pesos. In his desperation, after these many long years of suffering his wife’s embarrassing behavior, Merino avowed it would serve Justice if the alcalde ordinario would “mandate that [Francisca] be held in [Santa Marta], or in the monastery of Your determination, and Sandoya in the Yaruqui textile factory for the space of two years, or for the time period Your Honor determines….” Within the week, the alcalde had collected testimony from three witnesses (Julean Begara, Pedro Lopez de Soliz, and Phelipe Suares, all vecinos in their late 40s and early 50s) suggested by Merino, all of whom swore to the long term adultery of Francisca Naranjo and Xavier Sandoya, as well as to the rest of Merino’s story. Based on Merino’s petition and the witness testimony, on 27 April 1770 Lastra issued an official arrest warrant for Francisca to continue to be held in Santa Marta and for Sandoya to be confined to the city’s military barracks. Sandoya was spared the city jail because as a soldier he was entitled to the protections of the military fuero. Officially, the couple’s crime was public, scandalous cohabitation.<a href="#fn:fn6" id="fnref:fn6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">12</a>  </p> 
<p>The terms of the prosecution of Francisca Naranjo and Xavier Sandoya were thus set by the denunciation filed by Alexo Merino. As I will discuss further in a few minutes, the nature of criminal prosecution in the early modern Spanish legal system hinged upon two significant elements, regardless of the nature of the crime&#8211; the assumed guilt of the accused, and the concentration of investigatory, prosecutorial, and adjudicating authority in the singular office of the magistrate. As with other legal acts in the Spanish system, this concentration of authority was tempered by a labyrinthine legal corpus and a complex of overlapping, competing jurisdictions that countervailing parties could bring to bear on one another. In the initiation of a case, however, the discursive limits of the prosecutorial moment were established by the first act denunciation/accusation, which set the terms of guilt by which the magistrate would proceed.</p> 
<p>It’s not surprise that we find a thirteen year old illicit relationship before a magistrate in the 1770s in city of Quito. The larger socio-political circumstances that surround this case grew directly out of a crisis of royal authority propelled by attempts to centralize royal control. In May and June of 1765, the barrios of Quito revolted over viceregal plans to restructure the audiencia’s cane liquor monopoly (estanco de aguardiente) and sales tax collection (alcabala), precipitating a crisis of royal authority in the region.<a href="#fn:fn7" id="fnref:fn7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">13</a>  In the wake of the Rebellion of the Barrios, royal government faced the difficult task of reestablishing its legitimacy, while under constant pressure from the viceroy to restart fiscal reorganization. Before royal government could successfully implement fiscal reform, institutional authority reasserted itself first through policing barrio bodies and behaviors.  In the years immediately following the Rebellion, the city’s magistrates began to take a keen interest not only in debt, theft, and violent crime, but also in broadly defined offenses against public morality.  The policing of the city represented a new imperative of control over the subjects of Quito, whose relationships to imperial rule were brought under the scrutiny of an increasingly interventionist judicial apparatus.<a href="#fn:fn8" id="fnref:fn8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">14</a> Through this insitutional initiative, long-standing extra-marital sexual relationships were transformed into public, notorious, and scandalous objects of criminal prosecution. In the process, the popular connotations of terms like public, notorious, scandalous, and even marriage were revealed to be fluid and disarticulated from secular and religious discourses that emphasized paternal authority, filial obedience, and marital sexual propriety.<a href="#fn:fn9" id="fnref:fn9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">15</a>  </p> 
<p>Royal government was not fully reestablished in Quito until September 1766 with the belated arrival of troops from Guayaquil and Panama. Jail censuses from the three years that followed restoration reveal a startling increase in detentions of both men and women.<a href="#fn:fn10" id="fnref:fn10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">16</a> From an average of 60 detentions per year in the period prior to the rebellion, arrests rose to 372 in 1767, 453 in 1768, and 514 in 1769.<a href="#fn:fn11" id="fnref:fn11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">17</a>  The sheer growth in numbers is impressive, but more importantly the details of the arrests reveal a transformation of policing in the city. The primary goal of the city’s magistrates was to reaffirm order in the barrios, a goal exercised largely through moral enforcement.  Reasons for detention fit within six broad categories: debt, slavery, moral crime, property crime, violent crime, and undetermined.  Moral crimes included detentions for gambling, prostitution, illicit cohabitation, adultery, rape, statutory rape, bigamy, detention at the request of a parent or spouse, abuse of power, disrespecting royal officials, drunkenness, and providing false testimony.  Also included in this category are arrests that occurred during nightly rounds (ronda) of the city’s neighborhood. It is immediately evident that female defendants were apprehended for moral crimes at a rate inordinate to men.  Close to 30 percent of total arrests were women accused of moral crimes, particularly illicit cohabitation and apprehension by the ronda.  Detentions of women for sexual offenses more than tripled in the course of three years, from 21 in 1767 to 90 in 1769.  Male arrests for sexual offenses grew at a similar rate, if diminished in raw numbers, from 14 in 1767 to 50 in 1769.  Taken together, male and female moral crimes accounted for 46 percent of arrests for the period 1767-1769.  At the peak in 1769, 56 percent of all detainees were taken into custody for moral transgressions! Those arrests that made it to the point of prosecution were treated in a predictable manner.</p> 
<p>Standard criminal procedure held that cases could be started through one of three means: denunciation, accusation, or at the initiative of judicial officials (de oficio).  Third parties made denunciations, while accusations were made by material victims.  In both cases, a petition would be submitted to one of the judicial authorities of the corregimiento requesting judicial intervention.  Following the complaint, officials performed an official investigation (prueba), producing a summary report of charges and evidence (sumaria).  During the course of the investigation, witnesses were read the allegations and asked to respond, either through a list of questions submitted by the plaintiff or more generally as to their knowledge of the allegations.  Witnesses would swear and sign, if literate, their statements, all of which was recorded by a court notary. In cases where warranted, a physical examination of victims or the accused would be performed by a surgeon and reported in the sumaria.  Based on the accumulated evidence of the investigation, the presiding magistrate then ordered the arrest and confession of the accused.  The term confession was used for the questioning of a defendant because the Hispanic legal system presumed the guilt of the accused.  As a result, the defendant was placed in a defensive position, forced to deny allegations that were framed as positive indictments.   The accused could offer contradictory petitions or witnesses after the confession, used to corroborate their version of the story.  This sparked a back-and-forth that ended when the judge felt both sides had exhausted legal arguments or people ran out of money. Combined with a recommendation by the state’s attorney (fiscal), the case would then be forwarded to definitive sentencing.  The discursive conventions of criminal prosecutions were set by the investigating magistrate, almost exclusively in response to the terms of the initial complaint. The confession, contradictory interrogatories, and follow-up petitions provided by defendants were rare moments in the development of a case in which that discursive dominance was potentially, even if only temporarily, broken. This context must be considered when evaluating the language and structure of witness testimony, the confession, and later post-sentencing appeals. The discursive disjunctures likewise open a window to barrio life less determined by the norms pressed by magistrates, as the cases discussed below demonstrate. Finally, I would not that in cases with appeals that post-date the definitive sentencing, these appeals often starkly contrast with the linguistic engagement that defendants used during the confession and in the midst of their counter petitions and interrogatories. In the late eighteenth century in particular, this discursive shift moved towards a pastoral appeal to the magistrate that combined an avowal of one’s moral correction with an appeal to mercy&#8211; a reaffirmation of dominate (ie, institutional), disciplinary norms.</p> 
<p>Let’s return to the story of Alexo, Francisca, and Xavier. Following the initial investigation and the sumaria, Lastra took the confessions of Xavier and Francisca from their respective jail cells with an interrogatory patterned directly on the accusations of Alexo Merino. The couple denied each of Merino’s allegations, but the alcalde found their responses less than compelling.  In particular, both defendants denied that Xavier had been exiled to Guayaquil, and claimed instead that he had been sent there in his capacity as a soldier. They also claimed that their relationship had been intermittent over a period of just eight years and that la Xarra had offered the alcalde de barrio just 25 pesos to dispense with their seizure by the ronda. Following established procedure, the content of the confessions was communicated to Alexo Merino, who filed a response calling for Xavier to be banished from Quito, to a point far enough away that he could not return easily. He also requested his wife be retained in Santa Marta for whatever period of time the alcalde would deem required for her “to know her reformation.”<a href="#fn:fn12" id="fnref:fn12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">18</a> Merino reasoned that the penalties were more than justified as the couple was “apprehended in the actual act in which they were engaged in total scandal and freedom, nestled together in a underground room in order to enjoy themselves, hidden from the conscientious vigilance of Justice….”<a href="#fn:fn13" id="fnref:fn13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">19</a> He further argued that canon and civil law provided the death penalty for adulterers, particularly those caught in the act, and that the husband should be the arbiter of the severity of punishment, up to and including death. It was in the interests of “charity,” “justice,” and “good conscience” that Merino repudiated such calamitous punishment in favor of the more lenient castigation he requested. As noted earlier, murder of the offending spouse and her lover was acceptable in Hispanic law only if the husband himself discovered them flagrantly in the act, and only if he, consumed by an intoxicating passion, killed both offenders. Merino’s rather casual interpretation of the law was disingenuous, but certainly designed to enhance his personal standing before the judge. The reason for this desire soon became clear. </p> 
<p>On 18 May, the latest petition of Alexo Merino was forwarded to the imprisoned defendants, who produced responses that impugned the character, behavior, and legal reasoning of their accuser. Interestingly, Xavier’s response questioned the a priori assumption of criminal adultery from a variety of angles. First, he claimed that any actual consummated adulterous acts began more than five years earlier, placing the relationship outside the statutory limitations for accusation. Furthermore, he claimed that for adultery to exist, there had to be a functioning marriage. “It is equally certain that legally there is no Adultery if there has been no violation of the Conjugal Bed.”<a href="#fn:fn14" id="fnref:fn14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">20</a> As evidence that Xavier could not have violated his lover’s marriage, he explained that from the moment they wed, Merino had lived a “scandalous life,” cheating on his wife, beating her to the point of miscarriage (abortar) during an early pregnancy, and voluntarily adandoning her to live a separate life. “It was in these circumstances that I met [her], the marital bed of his wife abandoned for years. One could not call [their relationship] conjugal, as the word insinuates the cohabitation of consorts.”<a href="#fn:fn15" id="fnref:fn15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">21</a> Given the situation, Merino denied the possibility of having committed adultery. Their marriage was wrecked by Merino’s own behavior, and therefore Sandoya reasoned,  “in view of the fact that Merino cannot hold me responsible for breaking up his marriage, nor could he fault his wife’s prostitution, nor can Merino condemn as Adultery a friendship that was not the cause of the disasters that proceeded it; … nor can a man be faulted for coming to know a married woman free from Subjection because she was abandoned by her husband….”<a href="#fn:fn16" id="fnref:fn16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">22</a>  If there was no functional marriage to break up, then there could have been no adultery, particularly if the accusing spouse was himself culpable for the offense. Merino’s particular sin, in the eyes of his wife’s lover, was in abanDoning his marital responsibilities in the first place, leaving her without semblance of a real marriage. The argument deconstructs concepts of marriage, fidelity, adultery, and scandal by placing these concepts along a continuum of acceptability. The greater sin was Merino’s, not his wife’s. Her transgression was rooted in the search for companionship in a substitute relationship when faced with an abusive, duplicitous husband. </p> 
<p>Francisca Naranja’s petition echoed the arguments of her lover. Claiming the honorific Doña, Naranja requested that Lastra investigate her husband’s infidelities before he pass judgment on her unfortunate lot. The picture framed by Naranja and Sandoya was a mirror opposite to that posited by Merino. Moreover, the arguments employed open the question of popular versus institutional understandings of marriage. Naranja reasoned, “it is well known through municipal, canon, and civil law that in order for a male spouse have the right and ability to accuse his wife of the crime of adultery, it is necessary to have complied exactly with the obligations of an honorable husband; that is, to provide to her with food and clothing… as well as to be well ordered in his habits and morals, to be a good example to his wife, that she enjoy the love and good treatment required of both spouses to give one another….”<a href="#fn:fn17" id="fnref:fn17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">23</a> With this expression of legitimate matrimony, Naranja then proceeded to catalogue the mistreatments, infidelities, and neglect occasioned her by Merino, detailing in depth his “scandalous incorrigibility.” Doña Francisca’s appeal to the law was inexact, containing no references to specific entries in the Siete Partidas, the Recopilación, or any other recognized legal corpus. Rather, she referenced the vague notion of municipal, canon, and civil law as upholding a certain form of honorable marital obligation. The phrase “it is well known” parallels the standard for punishable illicit sexual activity—that an act be public and notorious—and as such inverts the meaning of legitimate and illegitimate marital behaviors.</p> 
<p>The magistrate’s institutional control over the discursive limitations on acceptable sexuality was broken by Doña Francisca and Xavier’s confessional denials and formalized responses to the legal and social evidences presented by Alexo Merino. The texture of the denials as well as the countervailing arguments, and their eventual success, suggest together with the long-term nature of their affair a level of social tolerance for adulterous behavior. Whether this behavior is accepted is less the point than its toleration. Further, the couple then sought explicitly to exploit the jurisdictional imprecisions of the system, appealing outright to the Audiencia as a circumvention of the alcalde’s authority, as a means undermining the alcalde and Merino’s control over the terms of the prosecution. It was the petitions of Francisca and Xavier, in this moment, that recast the discursive limitations of the case. </p> 
<p>As the weeks passed, Sandoya and Naranja continued to labor in their confinements while Merino protested their maligning of his character. In July the two detainees produced their own interrogatories as well as three witnesses each to testify on their behalf. Sandoya produced three men, two merchants and a third resident of Quito; Naranja produced another three men, one merchant, a presbyter, and a resident of Tumbaco. They also carried their case to the Audiencia, seeking to circumvent Lastra and the municipal authorities. As a result of their cumulative paper production, Naranja and Sandoya were released from prison by order of Audiencia judge Sebastian Salzedo y Oñate. Salzedo was unwilling to accept the force of the couple’s deconstruction of the meaning of marriage and its relation to adultery, but justified their release in the verity of Merino’s complicity in the same transgression. The adultery of both parties cancelled each other out. Naranja and Sandoya’s freedom came with an admonition to abanDon their illicit friendship under pain of future severe punishment lest they be caught again. Finally, all three parties were required to bear the costs of the litigation equally.</p> 
<p>Salzedo’s ruling was not handed down until 8 September, and while the accused couple ultimately regained their freedom as a result of Merino’s duplicity, they spent almost five months confined in Santa Marta and the city’s barracks. Merino, for his part, escaped scathed only by one third of the costs of the case. The procedural development of the case demonstrated the advantages of being the first to speak, along with the power of denunciation and of accusation. By all rights, Francisca Naranja could have followed the path of many other women in similar circumstances and denounced her husband, setting the discursive stage for his incarceration. She did not, it seems, because she had long before come to an acceptance that her marriage to Alexo Merino was a farce. In fact, it was only the public act of being caught by the ronda that motivated Merino to make his own accusation. It was the invasive presence of royal authority in the form of a vigilant barrio magistrate that brought the relationship to “public” light and forced a very long-term relationship into the realm of scandal and notoriety. One cannot imagine, however, that a relationship of a decade or more was not public knowledge prior to its entry into the judiciary. Surveillance made the adultery to fit the requirements of prosecution.</p> 
<hr /> 
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> 
<p>How, then, does this case speak to the flexibility and limitations of social categories in the Spanish system? First, let me note that this case is exemplary of the hundreds of cases of illicit cohabitation I’ve reviewed in Quito during the second half of the eighteenth century. Cumulatively, what the cases demonstrate is the extent to which sexual norms in the barrios of Quito differed from the prescriptive norms of church and state. That in and of itself is no profound observation. But, it is very interesting to witness the process by which concepts like public and notorious scandal, custom, practice, and of marriage itself were negotiated in the interest of communal harmony. It is impossible to imagine that a 13-year relationship passed under the radar of public scrutiny. As is almost always the case in sex prosecutions in Quito in the 1760s-1780s, long-term illicit sexual relationships were made notorious, and therefore scandalous, by an act of public denunciation motivated by something other than the sex— not by simple public knowledge. The ubiquity of this situation (and not just with cohabitation, but with more ‘abominable’ sex as well— including male sodomy and female sodomy) provides compelling evidence for tolerance of aberrant sex. Furthermore, Francisca and Xavier’s arguments before the magistrate appealed to, essentially, a fictional fuero that set a different bar for of legal obligation/legal right to conjugal authority. The notion of marriage as a contract between spouses was treated in their testimony by the same standards as the negotiated contract of consensual obedience that underwrote royal authority. Justice, and communal harmony existed in mutual obligation. Was this argument deployed simply because of the legal context (or, the legal manifestation of the cultural logic I’ve been discussing)? Or, does it point to a more fundamental cultural logic in action? Francisca’s husband had brought to bear, supposedly, the array of civil and ecclesiastical jurisdictions to his troubled marriage whenever his wife’s infidelity rose to the level of scandal. She, however, simply rejected the capacity of those jurisdictions to speak to her situation in the name of custom and right. She simply never complied. In the end, the magistrate was constrained by the law and his office to order reconciliation between Francisca and Alexo. And yet, despite the evidence of adultery on behalf of both parties he didn’t apply the full punishments available under the law. Why? While this paper’s conclusions are tentative, they do point (I hope) to the need for historians of gender and sex to consider more broadly the operation of authority in early Latin America, and how the similarities of that operation across a variety contexts may point to cultural structures rarely explicitly articulated, but surely evident of organizing logics in imperial society.</p>

<p>Lastra used the term <em>amancebamiento</em>, which the <em>Libro de los principios</em> defined as a single man and single woman living and sleeping togetehr “in one bed and house [causing] scandal in the Republic and Neighborhood,” a charge that could be brought either through denunciation or official investigation. Cutter (1994): 37. The <em>Libro</em> distinguishes between <em>amancebamiento</em> and <em>adulterio</em>, but does not include the term <em>concubinato</em>. In the Quito judiciary, all three terms appear for illicit relationships involving at least one married partner, with concubinato the most habitual.<a href="#fnref:fn6" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>The Rebellion of the Barrios, so called because insurrectionary activities radiated out of the city of Quito’s various popular parishes, has received extensive attention in the historiography of late colonial Quito. The rebellion occurred in two stages, first with a riot the night of 22 May 1765, and then with the more generalized insurrection that began on the night of 24 June.   Traditionally, the rebellion has been placed within a nationalist discourse as a predecessor of independence.  See, for example, de la Torre Reyes (1961): 147-154; and, González Suarez (1970 [1892]): 1121-1137.  For more recent analyses of the rebellion, including reconstruction of the events of May and June, see among others, Anthony McFarlane (1990): 197-254; Minchom (1994):  222-234; Kenneth Andrien (1990): 104-131; and, Black (2010): Chapter 1.<a href="#fnref:fn7" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Michael Scardaville (1994: 512) has documented increased community policing in the case of Bourbon Mexico City.  Schardaville found an increased interest in “proactive” policing of crimes like “vagrancy, illegal gambling, property crimes, and drink-related offenses” which ultimately led to “a ten-fold increase in the number of arrests and trials, the vast majority involving the urban poor, between the early 1780s and the late 1790s.”<a href="#fnref:fn8" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
