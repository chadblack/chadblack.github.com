  <h2>Cañeque, On Modernity, Colonialism, and the Spanish Inquistion</h2> 
<p>CLAH-AHA Boston, January 6-10, 2011<br /> 
<strong>On Modernity, Colonialism, and the Spanish Inquisition: Reflections on the Spanish Empire in the New World<br /> 
</strong><br /> 
Alejandro Cañeque University of Maryland, College Park  </p> 
<p>When it comes to defining the political nature of the Spanish empire in America historians in the English-speaking world have usually taken a binary approach. The Spanish empire is seen either as medieval and backward or as the harbinger of the modern state. Perhaps no one has expressed the first view in a more flamboyant manner than the still influential Irving A. Leonard, who contended that, in America, Spain created a “neo-medieval regime” which was “already an anachronism.”<a href="#fn:fn1" id="fnref:fn1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a>    In the view of other scholars, however, the Spanish monarchy erected a modern state apparatus in colonial Spanish America that pioneered new procedures of bureaucratic control, establishing a centralized and rationalized model of exploitation of the Indian communities. It foreshadowed the Weberian model of legal domination that did not become triumphant in the West until the nineteenth century. Thus, the power of the colonial bureaucracy was, by the standards of the time, tight and efficient. By imposing this heavy bureaucratic apparatus on society in order to avoid the formation of dominant social groups, the colonial state achieved a hegemonic role.<a href="#fn:fn2" id="fnref:fn2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></p> 
<p>One of the reasons why this dichotomy still dominates the study of the Spanish empire is that in recent decades most historians of colonial Spanish America have not shown an excessive interest in the study of the colonial state or the politics of imperial rule. Originally, this constituted a welcome reaction against the previous emphasis on the institutional and legal aspects of the Spanish dominion in America. Instead, the emphasis shifted to the social and economic aspects of the local colonial societies, along with their ethnic makeup. But one effect of this historiographical development has been that, while our knowledge of the social structure of colonial Spanish America has progressed in an impressive way, especially in regard to the subaltern groups of colonial society, our knowledge of the mechanisms of imperial rule has made no progress whatsoever in the last fifty years. The end result has been that, whereas we now have a highly developed and sophisticated understanding of the history of those formerly known as “the people without history” (i.e., Indians, slaves, peasants, castas, women, etc.), many historians still rely on rather antiquated views of the political structure of the Spanish empire, repeating again and again the same clichés that have been around for over half a century.<a href="#fn:fn3" id="fnref:fn3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></p> 
<p>Many of these problems are apparent in a recent work that sides with the modernist view of the Spanish empire, albeit bringing it up to date through the insights of postcolonial theory. In Modern Inquisitions: Peru and the Colonial Origins of the Civilized World, Irene Silverblatt argues that modern colonialism’s governing principles can already be found in the colonial empire created by Spain in the New World in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Despite the traditional image in the Anglo-American world of Spanish colonialism as backward and “medieval,” the truth is, Silverblatt asserts, that “Spain was in the vanguard of the modern world,” installing cutting-edge bureaucracies in its colonies around the globe, and with that, decisively contributing to the creation of the modern state. In that sense, there was no more modern bureaucracy in the Hispanic world than the Inquisition. The irony here, according to Silverblatt, is that this infamous institution, responsible to a large degree for the conventional image of the Spanish transatlantic empire as primitive and oppressive, was, in fact, part of the vanguard of the modern state, which is characterized by the production of rational and efficient bureaucracies and modern technologies of control and social discipline. Thus, through its practices, the Inquisition would have contributed to habituating the inhabitants of the Spanish colonies to “the structures of modern power, to the bureaucratic ways and manners of modern political life.” However, Silverblatt does not see the modernity of the Inquisition as something positive. In the last analysis, her project is a critique of the “terrible underside” or “subterranean stream” of modernity, that is, of the violence engendered by the civilizing project of European colonialism, as modernity and colonialism always went hand in hand. And the intertwining of modernity and colonialism got started, Silverblatt contends, not in the 19th century, but in the 17th, with the Spanish colonial project in the New World.<a href="#fn:fn4" id="fnref:fn4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></p> 
<p>Although this is certainly a provocative argument which may satisfy historians of colonial Spanish America by making their area of study more relevant to our present concerns, Silverblatt’s study is characterized by the same problems that have recently plagued the field of postcolonial theory and colonial studies: in its use of history as a tool to understand and critique the present, it creates a generic and rather ahistorical colonialism, located somewhere between 1492 and the 20th century. But, as Frederick Cooper has also recently argued, although trying to illuminate the present is a fine motivation for exploring the past, “doing history backward” has many risks. Its most obvious danger is that we may confuse “the analytic categories of the present with the native categories of the past.” What is more, we do not even bother to “ask about categories that are not now important, and we thus lose sight of the quest of people in the past to develop connections or ways of thinking that mattered to them but not to us.” Even more important, Cooper contends, is what one does not see: the paths not taken, the dead ends of historical processes, the alternatives that appeared to people in their time.<a href="#fn:fn5" id="fnref:fn5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a></p> 
<p>I think these arguments very much apply to Modern Inquisitions. For one thing, Silverblatt’s insistence on the importance of the Inquisition as a state-making institution can only make sense if we impose our political categories upon the social and political actors of colonial Latin America and imperial Spain. But, as I will try to show in this paper, the “state” and “state making” are among those categories which are important to us but which were irrelevant to seventeenth-century Spanish rulers. Using them obscures more than illuminates our understanding of the Spanish colonial world.</p> 
<hr /> 
<p>To begin with, the “state” as the normal form of political organization is a highly problematic concept when applied to the study of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and, as long as we don’t get beyond the state-building metaphor with its teleological implications, our understanding of the political nature of Spanish imperialism will always be inadequate. Since the Enlightenment, the western mind has seen the past primarily as the progenitor of the present, overemphasizing the evolutionary element in history.<a href="#fn:fn6" id="fnref:fn6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a>  Thus, the predominance of the ‘genetic approach’ has made the study of the beginnings of the modern centralized state and the emergence of a competitive state system a favorite theme for historians. A good example of this kind of approach is Philip Corrigan and Derek Sayer’s The Great Arch: English State Formation as Cultural Revolution. Theirs is a study of the growth of the state in England since the Middle Ages, their main argument being that the state emerges through a cultural revolution and that state formation is an essential aspect of capitalist civilization. The problem with their study is that they write, as one critic has put it, as if they were looking back down the tunnels of history, identifying all the continuities in this seemingly unstoppable process of state formation with the benefit of hindsight. Here, all roads lead to the capitalist state, even those of the remote Middle Ages. The fact is that the more one favors a diachronic model for explaining change, the more one tends to presume there is an order or structure in historical reality which exerts an independent influence on the behavior of human agents.<a href="#fn:fn7" id="fnref:fn7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a></p> 
<p>Not infrequently this approach has been related to the belief that ‘inferior’ or ‘inadequate’ stages have been left behind.<a href="#fn:fn8" id="fnref:fn8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a>  In the case of the Spanish monarchy, for example, the ‘statist paradigm’ has been used to explain its failure, the failure being its supposed inability to fully establish a centralized and bureaucratic government; in other words, the inadequacy of the Spanish monarchy lay in its incapacity to become a ‘true state.’ This is the kind of approach that has made prominent historians such as John H. Coatsworth contend that the colonial state was effective only in extracting resources, regulating economic activity and discouraging economic growth. In everything else, the colonial state was extremely weak by European standards of the time; it was just “an empty Pandora’s Box.”<a href="#fn:fn9" id="fnref:fn9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a>  In a similar vein, and speaking of the specific case of the viceroyalty of Peru, Kenneth J. Andrien has argued that, though the Spanish government was able to create a powerful state apparatus in colonial Peru thanks to the reforms of viceroy Toledo in the 1560&#8217;s, this was a passing phenomenon, as many of the Toledan reforms were undermined by local interests, both Spanish and Andean. By the mid-seventeenth century, the colonial state had become weak, corrupt, and inefficient.<a href="#fn:fn10" id="fnref:fn10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">10</a></p> 
<p>This fixation with the state is also probably one of the main reasons why so many historians are so prone to emphasize the ‘medieval’ aspects of colonial Latin America as a way to explain its ‘failure’ to modernize. Such a reasoning, however, has a serious flaw. By adopting a conceptualization of the political order that had not yet been formulated, it is assessing the political system of the Spanish monarchy using assumptions and principles that were not those on which it was built. In that regard, it attributes to the Spanish monarchy deficiencies that only make sense if they are seen from our present viewpoint. The same can be said of those who argue that an institution like the Inquisition was in the forefront of efforts to build the modern state.</p> 
<p>The fact is that the modern concept of the state—an entity with a life of its own, distinct from both rulers and ruled, and able, in consequence, to call upon the allegiances of both parties—had not yet come into reality in the early modern period. As Quentin Skinner has shown, when Hobbes introduced the term ‘state,’ around the middle of the seventeenth century, to denote the highest form of authority in matters of civil government, it was still a relatively new and contentious term. So were the notions that the duties of subjects were owed to the state, rather than to the person of a ruler or to a multiplicity of jurisdictional authorities (local or national as well as ecclesiastical or secular).</p> 
<p>From its origins, the ‘absolute monarchy’ was never a centralized system of government, with a bureaucracy which faithfully followed the king’s orders. Political power was dispersed into an array of relatively autonomous centers, whose unity was maintained, more in a symbolic than in an effective way, by reference to a single ‘head.’ This dispersion corresponded to the dispersion and relative autonomy of the vital functions and organs of the human body, which served as the model for social and political organization. This way of conceiving the political community made impossible the existence of a completely centralized political government—a society in which all power was concentrated in the sovereign would be as monstrous as a body which consisted only of a head.</p> 
<p>This is the paradox, from the modern standpoint, of the political system that existed before the modern state: ‘absolute’ monarchical power was compatible with the existence of other powers endowed with ample autonomy, without the center demanding the elimination of the peripheral powers.<a href="#fn:fn11" id="fnref:fn11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">11</a> In relation to this, it should be noted that ‘centralization,’ a term that belongs to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, implies a complete bureaucratic hierarchy, a fully organized system of government with an unbroken chain of command; however, the ‘absolutist’ hierarchy was incomplete at the lower end and monarchic authority at the local level continued to be problematic. At the local level the Crown was able to exercise effective control only extraordinarily and erratically (the corregidores or district magistrates are a good example of this in Spanish America, since they were often less than reliable instruments of royal authority). This was the paradox, so common of absolute monarchy everywhere in Europe, of “absolute authority and limited power,” or in the words of Jaime Vicens Vives, “the maximum concentration of authority at the summit and the minimum irradiation of that power downward,” which in Castilian terms would translate as “absolute obedience and limited compliance.”<a href="#fn:fn12" id="fnref:fn12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">12</a></p> 
<hr /> 
<p>All of these arguments can be applied to the Inquisition, an institution which was driven by the same ways of understanding the political community, and it used the same methods as the rest of the institutions of colonial rule. In that sense, it was more “medieval” than modern. This can be easily appreciated in two of its most notorious activities: the celebration of spectacular autos-da-fé and the use of torture during the interrogation of suspects.</p> 
<p>After Michel Foucault published Discipline and Punish in 1975, our view of penal practices and torture in early modern Europe was radically altered. Foucault’s work showed how the brutal and physically destructive forms of punishment under the ancien régime were transformed into the psychological reforms of the nineteenth-century prison. According to Foucault, the theory of the absolute monarchy enabled power to be founded in the physical existence of the sovereign, but not in continuous and permanent systems of surveillance. That is why the authority of the absolute sovereign was based on “spectacular and discontinuous interventions of power, the most violent form of which was the ‘exemplary,’ because exceptional, punishment.”<a href="#fn:fn13" id="fnref:fn13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">13</a></p> 
<p>In this sense, the auto-da-fé can be understood as one of those exemplary ceremonies of pre-modern Europe by which power was manifested. In the colonial world, the “liturgy of punishment” through which royal power was manifested also played its role, with public executions of criminals and autos-da-fé taking place regularly.<a href="#fn:fn14" id="fnref:fn14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">14</a>  Irene Silverblatt, however wonders that, if we are to believe Foucault’s arguments, then the Inquisition’s autos-da-fé do not make any sense, as these spectacles do not fit into our understanding of the tribunal as a modern institution. She contends that the problem lies with Foucault’s theories, as they do not account adequately for the processes of change. He was never very clear, Silverblatt tells us, about when the shift from the spectacle of public punishment to a regime of surveillance took place; as a consequence his theory is unable to account for an anachronism like the auto-da-fé.<a href="#fn:fn15" id="fnref:fn15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">15</a></p> 
<p>I think, however, that Foucault’s arguments make perfect sense when applied to the Inquisition’s rituals. In fact, the anachronism lies in seeing the Inquisition as a modern tribunal, instead of what it actually was: an institution of the ancien régime based on principles that differed radically from those on which the modern disciplinary state apparatus is based. Furthermore, although it is true that Foucault finds traces of the new disciplinary regime starting in the 17th century, he is very clear as regards the moment when the transformation of the system of punishment took place: in the late 18th and the early 19th centuries. In this sense, the auto-da-fé was no anachronism but rather a typical ritual of power in the pre-modern era (of course it was also a quintessentially Spanish ritual in that in no other European country did the Inquisition play such a prominent role). As I have shown elsewhere, the auto was a ceremony of power with multiple meanings. It was a religious performance that revealed the fate sinners would have to face when the Last Judgment Day came. It was also a political ritual in which imperial power was manifested through the horrors inflicted on the transgressors of the established order. As such it had many characteristics in common with the rituals of public execution in early modern society. That is why the viceroys played a role as fundamental as that of the inquisitors on the stage of the autos. In this theater of power, politics and religion were inextricably bound together, for, in the era before the “modern” state, the religious was always political, and politics was invariably shaped by religion.<a href="#fn:fn16" id="fnref:fn16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">16</a></p> 
<p>I would like to emphasize here the close relationship that existed between power and ritual in the early modern Spanish world. It was precisely because the concept of the impersonal state had not yet entered the political imagination that public rituals played such an extraordinary role. The emergence of the modern concept of the state as both a supreme and an impersonal form of authority brought the displacement of the belief that sovereignty is intimately connected with display. In sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spanish empire this transfer had not yet occurred and thus the belief that authority is intimately connected with display was still very much alive.<a href="#fn:fn17" id="fnref:fn17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">17</a></p> 
<p>It is precisely because the Inquisition was not driven by modern ideas of the state that the ritual of the auto-da-fé occupied such a prominent role in the inquisitorial imagination. The same can be argued in relation to the question of torture. Referring to the methods of the Inquisition, Silverblatt has argued that torture has played a role in the development of modern institutions of government; bestowed with legitimacy by state institutions, torture has been intrinsic to our civilization.<a href="#fn:fn18" id="fnref:fn18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">18</a>  I think that this is, again, the wrong argument for demonstrating the modernity of the Inquisition. As Michel Foucault convincingly demonstrated in Discipline and Punish, what characterizes the modern state is not the use of torture, but its absence. The punitive practices of the modern state no longer touch the body, but instead fringe on the “soul.” Modern civilization abolished torture and public punishment because of the reduced need for those in power to control the body of the criminal. Power in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was exercised far less through physical coercion than through &#8220;carceral&#8221; institutions. </p> 
<p>As Edward Peters has observed, what differentiates the use of torture in the seventeenth century from its use in our modern world is that the legal anthropology of the ancien régime presupposed a group of intractable criminals, capable of resisting pain to an extraordinary degree, requiring pain to speak the truth, but invariably truthful when tortured. On the other hand, the technology of torture in the twentieth century is in part the result of a new anthropology and its auxiliary technology. It is not primarily the victim&#8217;s information, but the victim, that torture needs to win—or to reduce to powerlessness.<a href="#fn:fn19" id="fnref:fn19" title="see footnote" class="footnote">19</a></p> 
<p>The use of torture by the Inquisition was part of the customary judicial practices of pre- modern Europe. The system of proof required the use of torture. This system had developed in the thirteenth century. When the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 abolished the ordeals, the nonrational proofs of Germanic antiquity, it destroyed an entire system of proof. The Roman- canon law of proof was the successor to the ordeals. In this system, judicial discretion was eliminated, forbidding the judge to convict upon circumstantial evidence. This had to be so in order to persuade men to accept the judgment of professional judges, instead of remitting the decision to God, as it was the case with the ordeal system. Thus, the judge could only condemn a criminal upon the testimony of two eyewitnesses or when the accused himself would admit his guilt. Confession therefore became regina probationum.<a href="#fn:fn20" id="fnref:fn20" title="see footnote" class="footnote">20</a>  Torture then was not a means of proof, but a means of obtaining a confession. It did not intend to force a guilty plea, but a specific statement that contained details that none but the criminal could possibly know. Hence, the accused would be preached and implore to make a confession, and to this end he was often shown the instruments of torture before the application itself. In the opinion of Edward Peters, compared to the old forms of procedure, the new inquisitorial process appeared far less repugnant to contemporaries than it may at first seem to us. It was certainly more professional. At its outset in the twelfth-thirteenth centuries at least, this procedure seemed to reflect that reliance on reason that historians have praised in other aspects of life in this period.<a href="#fn:fn21" id="fnref:fn21" title="see footnote" class="footnote">21</a></p> 
<p>By the seventeenth century, nevertheless, the Roman-canon law of proof was starting to lose its force. A new system of proof, free judicial evaluation of the evidence, was developed in the legal science and the legal practice, alongside the Roman-canon system. This development liberated the law of Europe from its dependence on torture. Torture could be abolished in the eighteenth century because the law of proof no longer required it.<a href="#fn:fn22" id="fnref:fn22" title="see footnote" class="footnote">22</a>  Therefore, the use of torture by the Spanish Inquisition in the seventeenth century was not a sign of the advent of the modern world, but, quite to the contrary, a thoroughly pre-modern penal procedure.<br /> 
There is another aspect of inquisitorial activity that will help to further show how removed the ideological underpinnings of the tribunal were from our modern conceptions of power. Since its beginnings in the late 16th century, the colonial Inquisition was continually embroiled in conflicts with the other institutions of colonial power. By the end of the 17th century this had become a problem of such a magnitude that, in a long report sent to Charles II by the Council of the Indies around 1696 regarding the excesses of the American Inquisitions, the councillors contended that the abusive use of its power by the Inquisition had surely provoked a great “hatred” among those inhabitants of the Indies who had been subjected to such abuses, as it was love and respect which made authority be venerated and not servile fear, like that prompted by the inquisitors’ methods and abuses.<a href="#fn:fn23" id="fnref:fn23" title="see footnote" class="footnote">23</a>  In the councillors’ minds, therefore, the conduct of the inquisitors put at risk the king’s authority over his American dominions, where his authority needed to be revered more, due to the great distance that separated those lands from the monarch. But why would an institution thought to be an essential part of the Spanish empire and that on which its security rested behave in such an unpredictable way? I believe the answer lies in the peculiar conception of power that was characteristic of the Spanish empire, a conception that was radically different from the modern conception of state power.</p> 
<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (especially before the system created by the Peace of Westphalia), the global political order was still conceived of in terms of ‘Christendom’ rather than in terms of independent ‘states’ and the universalism of the imperial idea was actively present in the Spanish monarchy as a ‘catholic (universal) monarchy.’ Thus, the relation between the Church or the Inquisition and the ‘colonial state’ cannot be conceived of as simply a relation of subordination of the Church or the Inquisition to the power of the state. This is not to deny that the monarchs always tried to exert the greatest possible control over the clergy and the inquisitors of their kingdoms, but to emphasize that the relations between civil power and spiritual authority took place in a context in which canon law enjoyed great preeminence (still far from the statist concept of the law, which conceives the state as the only true sovereign entity). These relations, thereby, could only be understood as relations between the ‘civil power’ and the ‘spiritual power.’ The fundamental implication of this would be that by preventing the establishment of fully secular principles of government, this dual constitution of power represented an insurmountable obstacle in the creation of a political organization of a state nature.<a href="#fn:fn24" id="fnref:fn24" title="see footnote" class="footnote">24</a></p> 
<p>Power, therefore, is conceived of in a dual way and expressed in the form of ‘jurisdictions.’ The concept of jurisdiction is crucial because it implies the political-juridical autonomy of the different social bodies. In the juridical and political language of the time, power is always designed and understood as ‘jurisdiction,’ and this is so because the activity of the authorities is mainly oriented towards the resolution of conflicts among different spheres of interest, conflicts that the authorities solve ‘doing justice.’<a href="#fn:fn25" id="fnref:fn25" title="see footnote" class="footnote">25</a>  The function of the head of the body politic is not to destroy the autonomy of the different social bodies but to procure the harmony of all the members of the body politic, guaranteeing every one’s statute, right, or privilege (iurisdictio literally means the act of saying the law).</p> 
<p>According to the doctrine of the “two swords” or the two powers, Church and clerics were exempt from the prince’s jurisdiction, since the prince lacked spiritual power and could not impose temporal power over non-temporal institutions. The Church was governed by its own set of rules and regulations—known as canon law—which were completely independent from the temporal laws of the realm. This allowed a very small margin of influence of the secular powers over Church law. Though never attempting to suppress Church autonomy, royal power would try<br /> 
to limit it through different means (by demanding, for instance, the royal approval of all papal decrees; by asserting the subjects’ right to appeal to the king the sentences of the ecclesiastical courts; or by imposing royal patronage). While this regalism served to recognize symbolically the preeminence of the Crown as head of the body politic, at the less apparent but not less effective jurisdictional level (that is, in the everyday practice of power), Church autonomy was still of enormous significance in the seventeenth century.<a href="#fn:fn26" id="fnref:fn26" title="see footnote" class="footnote">26</a></p> 
<p>In the case of the Inquisition, the Holy Office was an ecclesiastical tribunal because any authority and jurisdiction exercised by the inquisitors came from Rome. But the Inquisition was also a secular tribunal, exercising power delegated by the crown. The king, as patron of the Holy Office, possessed the right to nominate its highest official, the inquisitor general. Formally, no other official of the Inquisition might be nominated by the king for his appointment by the Holy See. Although it is true that the members of the Council of the Inquisition were appointed by the king, this appointment was in a certain way conditioned to the will of the inquisitor general, since the monarch had to choose the councillors from a list of three candidates submitted by the latter. Except for the treasury officials, the rest of the officials of the Inquisition, including the inquisitors of the different tribunals, were appointed exclusively by the inquisitor general. The king was expected to ensure the correct functioning of the institution, having the obligation, as its patron, to provide the economic resources necessary for its sustenance, but this gave him no right to interfere with the activities of the Inquisition. Moreover, the secular privileges awarded to the Inquisition had the effect of increasing the jurisdiction of the Holy Office but not the possibilities of the Crown of intervening in its affairs.<a href="#fn:fn27" id="fnref:fn27" title="see footnote" class="footnote">27</a></p> 
<p>This dual nature of inquisitorial power led to endless clashes between the Inquisition and the civil authorities, especially in the New World, where the enormous distance from the monarch would increase the tendency of the inquisitors to act autonomously from secular power. This argument contradicts the opinions of those who maintain that the tribunal was simply an instrument of monarchical absolutism. The fundamental question is that neither the inquisitors nor the other officials of the Inquisition were ministers of the king, nor did their appointment fall under the king’s prerogative. This was emphatically expressed by the anonymous author of the account of the funeral celebrated by the Mexican Inquisition for the death of Philip IV, according to whom the authority of the Inquisition was supreme, “the two arms of its power equally embracing the ecclesiastical and secular estates.” Proof of this supreme authority, the author tells us, was that none of the royal councils had jurisdiction over the Inquisition and that its officials were exclusively appointed by the inquisitor general or the Council of the Inquisition.<a href="#fn:fn28" id="fnref:fn28" title="see footnote" class="footnote">28</a> This is a decisive difference in a system of government in which both viceroys and oidores considered themselves to be the king’s servants. A further indicator of the autonomy of the Inquisition is the fact that the inquisitors were not supposed to inform the monarch regularly about their affairs, like other royal officials did. Instead, they usually wrote to the inquisitor general or to the Council of the Inquisition, as the Council of the Indies had no authority over the American inquisitors.<a href="#fn:fn29" id="fnref:fn29" title="see footnote" class="footnote">29</a>  It is therefore the peculiar dual nature of inquisitorial power that clearly separates the Inquisition from any modern bureaucracy intent on furthering the power of the state.</p> 
<p>In conclusion, as this paper has tried to demonstrate, the principles that guided the activity of the Spanish Inquisition in the New World were not those on which the modern state is based, and we should refrain from imposing modern categories and concepts on institutions and political structures that were governed by very different principles. All this, of course, does not mean the Spanish empire did not contribute anything to the history of modern colonialism. More than its bureaucratic or state-making practices, the real contribution of the Spanish colonial project to modern colonialism was its civilizing drive, its emphasis on the need to ‘civilize’ the natives. The importance of this civilizing mission should not be overlooked, since the entire Spanish colonial venture was predicated upon it.<a href="#fn:fn30" id="fnref:fn30" title="see footnote" class="footnote">30</a>  In any case, although the early precedent of Spanish “first imperialism” provided bearings and language for the emerging “new colonialism” or “second imperialism,” we need, nevertheless, to insist upon the historical alterity of Spanish colonialism in relation to eighteenth-century colonialism and, above all, the one that came into existence after the Industrial Revolution.  </p>

The three or four books most often cited by historians, when they need to refer to some political aspect of the Spanish empire, probably are Clarence H. Haring’s <em>The Spanish Empire in America</em> (published in 1947), Irving A. Leonard’s already mentioned <em>Baroque Times in Old Mexico</em> (published in 1959), John H.

<p>For an influential study that implicitly made this assumption, see Charles Tilly, ed., <em>The Formation of National States in Western Europe</em> (Princeton, 1975). More recently, Tilly has criticized his own approach for assuming that Europe’s genuine experiences of state formation belonged to France, Great Britain, and a few other countries, while other national experiences constituted failures, deviations, or derivative cases.

Obviously, I cannot agree with Charles Tilly’s argument, as presented in <em>Coercion, Capital, and European States</em>, according to which coercion (understood as the permanent presence of an armed force that constitutes the largest single branch of government ) was the central element of the pre-modern state. This argument can hardly be applied to colonial Spanish America, where there was never a standing army or regular police force. This is not to deny that coercion existed, since it indeed did, but permanent coercion was not a central aspect of the Spanish colonial regime, at least until the second half of the eighteenth century.<a href="#fnref:fn13" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
