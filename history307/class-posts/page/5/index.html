					<p>On the subject plaigerizing, I think that the reading, Historians in Trouble, was an interesting and insightful read. I have had several instances where I personally have encountered experiences of plaigerizing and the consequences involved. I go back in my memory to the first semester of my freshman year of college. At that time I was attending Pellissippi State Community College because my application to UT-Knoxville was accepted late so instead of waiting out a semester I decided to get some classes out of the way at Pellissippi State. So I signed up for the basic freshman classes like english 110 and to the lack of my knowledge the professor for that class was a nightmare. She was one of those real old school teachers who was all business and no play. She didn&#8217;t tolerate any type of distraction to the task at hand which was learning how to write research papers the correct way. The focus of the class was learning how to research and cite correctly while still writing in a way that is interesting to read. Anytime that any of the students in the class, including myself, made even the slightest mistake in citing the material we received an &#8220;F&#8221; for the assignment. Of course we were allowed to turn our papers in early if we wanted to so she could check it to make sure we did it correctly so that way we wouldn&#8217;t fail the class. So the importance of ethical research and writing was instilled in me ever since because I couldn&#8217;t tell you how many people received the dreaded &#8220;F&#8221; for their assignments which they felt was unfair because it was mostly because of a typo or something insignificant like that. But even though I felt at the time that I hated my teacher back then, I came away with a conditioned sense of writing with purpose and writing correctly so as to not plaigerize no matter what. Now I will say that to this day I still make slight mistakes when citing and, as does many other people when writing but it is the writer&#8217;s responsibility to be diligent when proofreading to catch those mistakes when they know that other people will be reading your work and placing their trust in your research. It was pretty concerning to me to find out how many proffesional historians or writers in general actually partake in this form of cheating for their own personal gain, to me it just is not worth it when you look at the consequences involved.

					<p>An idea that struck a chord as I read through the America Historical Association&#8217;s Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct and reflected on several other readings that we&#8217;ve encountered thus far in the semester: history as community. Shared ideas and principles that dictate the professionalism or truth of the subject. This idea implies that history is a discipline that is subject to the rule of law within that community and as we read this week members of that community, even distinguished members, consciously and unconsciously manipulate the values that all peoples of historical academia should comply.</p>
<p>During this weeks class discussion, one in which I think a lot of us really enjoyed, Jon Wiener&#8217;s<em> Historians in Trouble</em> focused on unprofessional malfeasance inside the realm of history. Parts of the book read like a poor attempt by some bad apples in the profession to exercise their value deficiencies as a power display. These members of the neo-con thought police unscrupulously used their expertise and connections to not only avoid due punishment, but were given prestige by power political forces in the face of obvious wrong doing. While other parts of the book seemed as if the individuals involved were less concerned about the truth of the historical record and more concerned with falsifying facts to support their bias beliefs.</p>
<p>One area that we touched on in class that the book whispered about was the lack of administration oversight in dealing with the problems of wrong doing. While not specifically dealt with in Wiener&#8217;s book the idea that administrations will harbor individuals not only accused of academic fraud, but the lack of concern for personal and professional protection some administrations displayed towards their student body. In an academic world fueled by money from special interest groups there&#8217;s little wonder of why administrations seemly turn a blind-eye towards the people involved in these scandals. Money vs. truth. Sadly truth pays the tab. &#8220;Integrity of the historical record&#8221; words to live by not words to manipulate. The historians in Weiner&#8217;s book lost focus of this pivotal reality. Every wrong actions can call into question the &#8220;integrity of the historical&#8221; record by no longer placing the focus on productive scholarship and healthy academic debate, but a reliance on the prestige of an individuals or an institution to clear-up wrong doing and cases that we saw simply swept the dirt under the rug without giving a second thought. What&#8217;s nice about real history is that these wrong doings are on record so that in future instances of academic fraud or unprofessional behavior, the community can and should take swift actions as to avoid these instances that call integrity into question.</p>

					<p>I was stunned at the blatant lack of ethics, morals, and trustworthiness of the historians and professors we read about in &#8220;Historians in Trouble&#8221;. The extent to which some of them abused their powerful positions, misquoted or misrepresented documents or facts, as well as flat out lying or covering things up was utterly appalling. Our entire academic careers the failures and consequences of cheating and plagiarizing has been bludgeoned and threatened by what would happen if we did not follow the rules. The AHA defines plagiarism as, “the expropriation of another author’s work, and the presentation of it as one’s own.&#8221; Citations are not hard, especially with the one click process the new Word program uses. It takes some serious lack of morals or an incredible amount of laziness not to cite your sources. A mistake or two may be understandable, we are human after all, but the gross amount of quotes not cited or completely made up by the author is completely unconscionable and wrong. If these individuals were still in college they&#8217;d be failing classes and possibly even expelled, yet some found places in the Bush administration or maintained their faculty position. The lack of punishment for these gross misconducts and betrayals is worse than the betrayal themselves. People who read monographs generally believe what they are reading and take it for granted that the author did the proper research and knows what he is talking about; it does not generally cross your mind that hey this individual may have made this up, or skewed the facts. The Statement on Standards makes it clear that historians do not make things up, yet that seems to be the very case for Weinstein who most likely made up large portions of his book. To begin with he was taking notes on someone else&#8217;s translation of the documents because he could not read Russian, second he paid off the KGB to NOT allow anyone else to see the records he used, as well as the tapes which dispute whether he misquoted interviewees have never been released. Weinstein obviously is hiding something major, like no basis for his book, and thesis, yet he was still put in charge of the National Archives by the Second Bush Administration. The lack of punishment and self-policing  the AHA and historians are witnessing is pathetic.

					<p>A central theme of Historians in Trouble is the implicit hypocrisy of people involved in writing history. Many of these historians behave unprofessionally insofar as the AHA guidelines articulate what historical professionalism entails. Chief among these unprofessional professionals is Allen Weinstein for the variety of his offenses over such a long span of time. Throughout the process of debate over his work, and even before the debate began, he flouted various key principles, as Jon Wiener demonstrates. During the process of research he violated the principle of &#8220;free, open, equal, and nondiscriminatory access&#8221; (AHA Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct) in gaining access to Soviet archives. After he came under attack, he never gave others access to his sources, dishonoring the historical record by intentionally obscuring a potentially &#8220;clear trail for subsequent historians to follow&#8221; (AHA). Yet his long record of errors is not merely a collection of mistakes. They are evidence of a general attitude. He is hostile to open debate. He does not accept that &#8220;historians often disagree and argue with each other&#8230;[that] interpretive disagreements are vital to the creative ferment of our profession, and can in fact contribute to come of our most original and valuable insights&#8230;that the resulting disagreements can deepen and enrich historical understanding by generating new questions, new arguments, and new lines of investigation&#8221; (AHA). He wanted to win, and end, the debate. Perhaps more than politics, this is the important similarity between Weinstein and the Bush administration: a closed approach to information. Of course, this is why his appointment as archivist was so startling.<br />
However, if part of what makes this hostility so reprehensible is his supposed adherence to a professional code of conduct, making him a hypocrite, then the American Historical Association itself is worthy of even more reproach than Jon Wiener gives. In their Statement on Standards, they write of two lines of defense against plagiarism. First, scholars must cultivate tidy work habits. The second line, though, &#8220;is organized and punitive. Every institution that includes or represents a body of scholars has an obligation to establish procedures designed to clarify and uphold their ethical standards&#8221; (AHA). Although they had a department for handling scholarly abuses, they often used it to brush Wiener&#8217;s complaints to a corner. If &#8220;the real penalty for plagiarism is the abhorrence of the community of scholars,&#8221; they need to bring these cases of dishonesty into the light as soon as possible. Furthermore, their abandonment of attempts to police scholars, mentioned in the conclusion of Historians in Trouble, takes both ethical and procedural clarity from the attempt to uphold historians&#8217; standards. This was what most surprised me in Weiner&#8217;s book: not right-wing organizations&#8217; persistence, but the degree of apathy in the AHA and among so many historians toward clear profession hostility to the principles of open debate and truth-seeking.</p>

					<p>Much like the previous post, I wish to spend a few minutes reflecting on topics not discussed during our class period. The case of Joesph Ellis interests me beyond any other. How important is the truth? I believe when you are responsible for transferring information from your mind to another that the truth is very important. Once trust is gone, it is difficult to regain. As students, we should be able to trust our professors with the information they offer. I am sure Ellis felt terrible for his lies; the point remains that he continuously and knowingly lied to his students.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there are multiple assaults against the &#8220;Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct&#8221; shown throughout Wiener&#8217;s book. I will begin with the excerpt &#8220;They do not fabricate evidence. . .&#8221;. This rule is completely ignored in the case of John Lott. Allegedly, Lott never performed surveys for his gun-related topic. This is problematic due to the fact Lott claims to have performed such surveys. If Lott were to be innocent it would be his fault for not keeping records or evidence of the surveys he claimed to have performed. Another rule clearly broken is that of &#8220;leaving a clear trail for subsequent historians to follow&#8221;. The standard was broken Allen Weinstein. By offering money for exclusive access he violated ethical conduct for a historian. Not only did Weinstein pay for exclusive access, he also demanded the people interviewed give no one else the same access. This in a sense is covering one&#8217;s tracks. It is absolutely ridiculous to hide the information which was found. It is vital for the history profession to be able to check and verify work. I believe this is how the profession evolves.</p>
<p>These were two glaring violations of the AHA&#8217;s standards. <em>Historians in Trouble</em> offered many more offenses which were equally repulsive. For the sake of repetition, I will limit the examples. I would like to point out that much of what is stated in the AHA&#8217;s standards is simply common sense. Any professional, regardless of profession, should realize most of these standards are correlated with having morals. It does not take a professional historian to realize fabricating evidence and discriminatory access is wrong.</p>
<p>It was stated during class that Wiener appeared to come off as biased and partisan. At first glance, this made me think less of his work as a whole. After reading the AHA&#8217;s standards, I completely recant any thought I had concerning Wiener being less of a reliable source. The standards clearly state a historian can practice history with integrity and have a specific point of view. This makes the profession much more interesting. Multiple and conflicting perspectives will attract people to the field of history. History being diverse is important for the field to grow.</p>

					<p>Sorry my notes got wet, I had another blog that I will try to attempt to rewrite exactly as I did to match the original document.</p>
<p>The American Historical Association issued a statement on standards of professional conduct in order to address some issues facing the historical community and provide a framework to provide “honor in their work.”  The standards state the “trust and respect of one’s peers and of the public at large are among the greatest and most-hard won achievements that any historian can attain.”  This trust is easily broken when one’s work is found to be full of plagiarism and can harm, if not destroy the person’s career.</p>
<p>Stephen Ambrose’s career and reputation have taken a large hit due to plagiarism complaints against him.  His book “The Wild Blue” contained nearly exact statements to Thomas Childers’s book “The Wings of Morning.”  This lead to further investigation and it was found that this was not his first, nor his last plagiarized work.  The AHA characterizes plagiarism as “the expropriation of another author’s work, and the presentation of it as one’s own…”  The best solution to this problem is to be as thorough as possible and cite everything.  Something I failed to consider about sources and footnotes was the fact that it aids future historians and researchers to continue on and further develop your theories or ideas.</p>
<p>A case that stood out to me from the reading was the Allen Weinstein case.  His first transgression was he paid former KGB agents for “exclusive” rights and access to the archives of the KGB.  This action was a clear violation of the “integrity of the profession” as the Standards call it.  Then to further tarnish his image Weinstein went to withhold the documents from allowing other historians to have access, as he promised.  The standards set by the AHA state that historians favor “free, open, equal, and nondiscriminatory access,” to archives.  Weinstein was further confronted with Navasky who tracked down his sources and sent them copies of the portions of their input that were used in the book.  All of the sources agreed that they were misrepresented or misquoted in some way (pg.40).</p>
<p>Jon Wiener’s, “Historians in Trouble” provided great insight into the mistakes that historians fall into and the damage that can be caused to one’s career.  The AHA’s standards set in place are strong on the integrity of one’s work. Historians face constant scrutiny anytime they uncover something is potentially controversial, it is vital the we have all the bases covered as historians in order to avoid embarrassing shame for failing to follow these standards.</p>

					<p>This week we read over Jon Wiener&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Historians in Trouble</span>. As the title implies, the book deals with professional historians who get into controversy and scandal. In class we discussed such controversies, mistakes, and scandals surrounding such historians. The worst included cases of outright plagiarism and sexual/administrative abuse. Others were undeserving of the treatment they received.</p>
<p>In all the book by Wiener shows that the academic profession of history is not an impregnable ivory tower separate from the rest of the world&#8217;s problems, biases, and shortcomings. It is indulged in the same competition, marketplace, power struggles,  and sinful shortfalls as the rest of humanity. Many of the examples were obvious ones and the unjust persecution of some historians showed how if you piss off the wrong people (who have power) you can find yourself without a job, academically shunned, and even under death threats.</p>
<p>The most practical lesson to learn from it (besides the above &#8220;don&#8217;t piss off the wrong people&#8221;) is that you should make sure you footnote everything, give credit when its due (quotation marks, etc.), and make sure your interpretation or translation of a document is correct. As Wiener quotes a source, being a historian working in an archive all day can make you rush and scribble down inaccurate notes which can alter your findings. Even if the error is small, as shown in Wiener&#8217;s book, you might lose your job because you pissed off someone with your findings/interpretation and they in turn hound you, the academic world, and your university over those few errors as if you were guilty of murder or blasphemy of some Biblical scale.

					<p>Before analyzing Historians in Trouble through the &#8220;Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct,&#8221; I would like to talk about something that I found interesting that we didn&#8217;t spend too much time in class on and that is the case of Dino Cinel.  The case shows the danger of giving tenure to a person in order to convince them to take the job.  Tenure shouldn&#8217;t be something to be given out freely to entice someone to take a job.  Tenure is something that should be earned since it is so powerful.  While I personally do not like how tenure can keep someone in a job a long time after being discredited, as this case was an example of, I do like the practice in general of requiring a book to be published and other requirements as we discussed in class.  That at least can help weed out some of the more ethically challenged professors which certainly is a good thing. </p>
<p>Moving on to the &#8220;Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct,&#8221; it really is quite amazing how the historians broke all these different rules.  It seems that once you get to a certain level, you are more likely to stop paying attention to the importance of professional conduct and start looking out for how to best help yourself.  At least most historians haven&#8217;t fallen into this problem.  But having already learned about what standards these historians have broken, I think it would be more interesting to look at Jon Wiener and his book through the &#8220;Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct.&#8221;  First, Wiener does a very good job at thanking people for their help in each of his chapters in the Acknowledgements section as the Statement suggests, &#8220;They [Historians] should always acknowledge assistance received from colleagues&#8230;and others, and give due credit to collaborators.&#8221;  He also does a good job at interpreting the past actions of historians and those actions meant by first asking questions about possible meanings and then choosing the likely one. </p>
<p>Although he wasn&#8217;t perfect in his adherence to the Statement.  A glaring problem, that was mentioned several times during class, was his bias in choosing the stories to write about.  He chose stories that really put the right-wing in a bad light and made it seem like they always liked to turn minor and trivial errors into huge political firestorms while also blaming a vast left-wing conspiracies when they get busted for harrassment or unethical behavior.  While these things certainly are good examples of historians in trouble, it seemed too slanted because the left wing certianly has similar issues, maybe not as much but still do and a story or two would have made Wiener&#8217;s book far better.  As the Statement says, &#8220;Professional integrity in the practice of history requires awareness of one&#8217;s own biases&#8230;&#8221;  Reading the book, it was clear where Wiener was coming from but it still would have been nice to have him explicitly state  it. </p>
<p>Also, during his chapter on <em>Arming America</em>, I found it a little problematic that he left out what Bellesiles said in his introduction, other than saying it was &#8220;a fierce attack on Charleton Heston and the NRA.&#8221;  He noted right after that the NRA was targeting him before the book came out but it had to have known about the introduction in addition to what was in the book.  Wiener should have mentioned what was specifically in the introduction instead of glossing over it and acting like it played a very little role in what followed.  It seems likely that an introduction attacking the NRA and Heston would have at least some effect on their actions and probably contributed to them trying to find any mistake to discredit him.  Even if the introduction played no role in the end, Wiener still should have mentioned that instead of leaving it up to the readers to come to that conclusion because it doesn&#8217;t seem so clearcut with how Wiener wrote the chapter.</p>

					<p>So I totally forgot about writing a blog post last week (I don&#8217;t have internet at home so I have to plan time at the library).  So this post is for last week&#8217;s readings/discussion, and my third week post will follow soon.</p>
<p>I want to comment, as some other folks did, on the question of language making reality.  I have a second major in philosophy (I like history better!) and have spent a good deal of time on post-structuralist (or postmodernist) thought, and this idea has always been one of my favorite things about the post-structuralists, especially Foucault and Derrida.  Essentially, I agree with the thesis that &#8216;reality&#8217; is constructed, or at least constrained, by language.  I consider the only meaningful uses of the words &#8216;truth&#8217; and &#8216;reality&#8217; to be in reference to sentient (not necessarily human) experience&#8211;which is not to say that nothing would exist without that experience, only that we can&#8217;t meaningfully talk or think about what it means for something to exist outside of experience. Foucault, who despite his criticisms of the possibility of doing history is in many ways an historian himself, deals with this in a really interesting way in writing the history of ideas (for example in his book <span style="font-style: italic;">The Order of Things</span>) where, instead of treating intellectual history as a neutral battlefield for rational arguments and events which evolve over time, he writes history as consisting of a series of epochs in which the &#8220;conditions of the possibility of knowledge&#8221; (essentially, the language and, hence, the intellectual frameworks that are available to humans) differ in ways that constrain all areas of human thought in particular ways.  Our own time is no exception, although Foucault&#8217;s histories all conveniently end before his own lifetime.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting, and maybe a little bit scary, to think about how this applies to history.  The Iggers book describes several epochs of thought in historical scholarship, each with its own ideas about the proper methods, subjects, and styles of writing appropriate to history.  Like Foucault, Iggers is much more careful about making sweeping claims about our own time, but if all other periods of historical writing (and human intellectual history generally) can be describes in terms of constraining frameworks, why not ours? It&#8217;s the conceit of every generation to believe at least implicitly that all previous generations had fatal flaws but we, at last, have a roughly complete and accurate view of things.  Post-structuralism has gone a long way toward forcing us to give up this conceit, but it certainly hasn&#8217;t purged the tendency for all of us as individuals to look at things this way.</p>
<p>The upshot is that our writings are not more &#8216;objective&#8217; or &#8216;true&#8217; than any of the older works that we&#8217;re eager to find fatal flaws in. The question becomes: if not to discover objective truth, what is the purpose of doing history?</p>

					<p>The thinkers loosely grouped as the postmodernists challenged all pursuit of knowledge, from literature to physics, as they saw that cultural, social, political, and linguistic forces shaped the process of creating truth. While they critiqued each branch of knowledge, not everyone seemed equally worried. For instance, in the world of literary theory, postmodern and post-structuralist thought shook the discipline at its very foundations. Those who interpreted literature and produced works of critique had to grapple with these concerns before they could continue interpreting and producing. On the other hand, while I&#8217;m sure postmodern ideas worried many philosophers of science, the actual pursuit of scientific knowledge seemed to continue without disruption, if the march of the computer is any evidence.<br />
Although one factor that divides these two responses is the distance between theory and practice, another factor is the aim of each. Directly linked to purpose of a discipline is the means of evaluating success. What was the aim of literary criticism? No one knew. Or, everyone knew, but for them. There was no consensus across the discipline. As a result, there was no clear means of evaluating the relative success of a given piece of criticism. Conversely, physics has long had a clear aim: understanding the workings of the matter and its motion. How do they know if they&#8217;ve understood? The knowledge is useful. Although there is no unified theory of physics, there have been clear leaps in people&#8217;s ability to control matter that testify that they are &#8216;close enough&#8217; to call it &#8216;true&#8217; knowledge. Truth seems to be that which is useful to believe is true. Thus, a crucial factor that separates literary studies and physics is utility.<br />
No wonder, then, that history reacted to the postmodern strain of thought in a way that lay in between the two. As we discussed, history contains elements that border on both the literary and the scientific. Its aim is a representation of the past much as the aim of science is a representation of certain phenomena. Yet its means contain large elements of the literary: metaphor, narrative, rhetoric. These were the elements that people can most easily see as evidence of biases. These came under attack. History as literature was shaken.<br />
However, I take heart from Iggers&#8217;s note that only Britain and America took the critique seriously. For although the postmodern critique deserved serious thought, it need not have slowed the pace of historical research. It resulted, not in the cessation of historical writing, but in the development of new methods, new ways of understanding language and culture. This was appropriate because history has utility. It might be that it has utility most obviously in sociology or economics, but these are disciplines which could not stand without the study of history. These disciplines know they are finding some degree of &#8216;truth&#8217; because their conclusions have utility. Thus, insofar as history helps further social sciences with direct use, history has a clear use.<br />
So while the social sciences each have a particular aim, history has no such immediate goal but instead works a step back from the desk of an urban planner or CEO. The result, though, is not a lesser degree of &#8216;truth&#8217;, which would curtail the relevance of historical thought. Instead, the result is a liberation. Historians have a greater freedom in language than the social sciences by virtue of spanning fields, taking on so many questions, and keeping from the fray of memos. Economics needs a particular language because it deals with such particular issues, ones that float at a distance from common use. Historian can use that language as well, but when they tackle issues that most people can understand without technical language, they are free to use a literary voice. This is the liberty historians have that I most appreciate. It allows history to be accessible, eloquent, and no less worthwhile. It is a lesson from Iggers I hope to remember in writing a thesis.</p>

					<p>Last discussion was interesting in regards to a few of the subjects. The technology aspect, especially corporations getting the same rights as a person gets was quite astounding. Them being aloud to push their own political agendas is ludicrous. Every election it feels like  new things are always coming about that are constantly devaluing a person&#8217;s vote. It just seems too crooked for my taste. Another aspect of the technological revolution, the internet, is a double edged sword. It helps because it&#8217;s much easier to access archives and to find scholarly articles, but at the same time it also gives any person the ability to write anything that they want on any subject they want. As a historian, or history student, you just have to drudge through the junk and get to the legitimate sources though. Technology has definitely changed everything for better and for worse. The article by Cronon on what it takes to be a historian is a good assessment of what we will be faced with in the future. Objectivity and good sources are the most obvious keys in my view. Some bias is aloud, but it needs to be kept at a minimum. In the past all the winners got to write history anyway they saw fit. Although now, with all the technology at our fingertips, historians need to strive to be as objective as possible when writing history. Narrative form also needs to be minimized to a degree so that books, articles, editorials, etc. can be easier, and better, reads. But really, objectivity is the name of the game. This is why all the internet drudgery is so redundant because most of it is so extremely biased. I prefer to find books that can be used as good sources, but the internet is a tool that makes it so much easier for everyone to get the information they need. Although this can turn into problems with plagiarism, especially in elementary education. Also something Cronon wrote that I am a big fan of is the fact that in history you can pick a specific time frame, event, and place and constrain your research to this. When you can keep you focus this narrow it makes it much easier to write a great work on that subject. All in all the technological impact on history is going to continue to grow, and I&#8217;m quite interested to see where it goes in the future. But regardless of what happens, archives and primary sources will always be the basis for good history.</p>

					<p>Since most of this week&#8217;s discussion focused on characteristics that delineate history from other subjects, I will start my reflection by talking about the one of these characteristics, the narrative.  Personally, I love narratives, and I love writing stories much more than I like writing essays or nonfiction.  I would have chosen creative writing as a major, but I did not feel like risking the possibility of being a starving novelist for the rest of my life.   However, I feel that the best in history writing has many similarities to a good novel; it richly develops many characters and moves toward some conclusion.  Unlike literature, historians deal with events and people that actually existed, but they are still allowed some leniency in order to create a compelling piece.  I agree with the postmodernists that pure objectivity is impossible; however, I feel that coming as close to objectivity as possible is not something that should be discounted.</p>
<p>The part of the reading I was most confused about was his postscript about the need for &#8220;global history.&#8221;  To me, this sounds similar to the single narrative of history that was disproved around the turn of the twentieth century.  Iggers counters this by saying that we need to look for common trends in  history rather than a single narrative with a beginning and an end point, but it is more likely that historians would ignore evidence that pointed against their global narrative rather than integrating it into their theory.  I am skeptical that any single trend of history can be truly &#8216;universal&#8217; and thus I feel that global history is an impossible pursuit.</p>
<p>Overall, I thought the Iggers book was a vital read, but I am happy that I made it through the book and managed to soak in most of the information.  <em>Historians in Trouble</em> was a much more entertaining and insightful read with the knowledge and viewpoint I gained from the Iggers book.</p>

					<p>The opening question in my notes reads as follows: &#8220;If you change language, do you change reality?&#8221; The simple answer, as we discussed in class, is no. You can call mercury go-go juice and die from drinking it. You can call something &#8220;non-consensual sex&#8221; and it still equates to rape, even as some terms may have very different connotations from their synonymous counterparts. However, our words and our language do have a lot more power than we would readily admit at times, which fits neatly in with the discussions of objectivity and known bias tackled later in the discussion.</p>
<p>My church bulletin contains a small box reading &#8220;Because words shape our thinking, we strive to use inclusive language in our worship.&#8221; In the case of my church, this often involves using non-gendered terms in hymns and sermons. But the power of language extends far beyond the Presbyterian Hymnal and well into the public sphere. When we discussed media and bias, we didn&#8217;t return to the conversation of language, but perhaps we should have. The words chosen by a particular writer or media personality (Nancy Grace, anyone?) are designed to elicit certain reactions from an audience. It&#8217;s all in the spin, and some of the spin is the phraseology. For example, referring to a prisoner as a &#8220;cop-killer in police custody&#8221; carries very different connotations than those of &#8220;person of interest held in connection with the crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>This can equally be applied to the writing of history. As we discussed bias, someone 9and unfortunately I can&#8217;t remember who) said that we should &#8220;use methods geared toward objectivity, even knowing it might not be achieved.&#8221; This was expanded in our list to regarding objectivity as a goal, with caveats of recognized biases in a format as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>Language can reveal our biases, and in the context of history, while it might not change reality, it can certainly change the perception of reality. We also addressed the quote &#8220;History is written by the winners.&#8221; This always reminds me of differing treatments of the Cold War in American and Soviet textbooks. Particularly when we study more distant events, we rely heavily on few first-hand accounts, limiting our perceptions and knowledge of the event and doubtless affecting our understanding of the period in question.</p>
<p>We also discussed whether it might be better to have a primary source with known biases, so as to better counter the biases in the interpretation, and this is another instance in which language and word choice can help us to better understand available information. As we make a &#8220;best faith effort,&#8221; language is an important factor to consider and to weigh in with the rest of our evidence.</p>

					<p>The discussion from Wednesday, brought up several interesting points that I feel have been  often over looked. While the process of professionalization, begun under the guidance of von Ranke, helps to legitimize the historical field and the historian, it also raises the question as to what role does commercialization play in the pursuit of history?  It would be a lovely world in which commercial interests did not play a pivotal role in the minds of historians, but, being the pesky creatures that we are, needing food and shelter, necessitate this evil. With this being the case, how do historians stay true and honest to their craft while simultaneously, being profitable? Additionally on this point, how does the historian reconcile an aspect of entertainment and interest in their work, while adhering to the code of conduct that has been established?<br />
	  In recent years, a number of historical tracts have come into popular culture and have made a name for their authors. 1776 by David McCullough, Band of Brothers by Stephen Ambrose, or the very popular works of Robert Remini, all fall into this category. While these men, and there have been many others, have come into the limelight of  prosperity because of their works, do these works compromise their professional ethos to achieve success? Works that have passed into mainstream literary culture do possess many of the establishments that von Ranke created, such as linearity of time and a grand narrative emplotment, I personally find a major difference from these works and those that would be “academic” works.<br />
	  While I cannot speak for everyone, I believe that there is a profound difference between the works that have  become popular and successful and those which have become successful in the academic circles. An example of this would be Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond. While this book has been wildly successful in bookstores, it has taken a great deal of criticism in the academic community. Iggers Historiography, while interesting, will never reach the bestsellers list. Is there a difference in professionalism between Stephen Ambrose and Robert Remini and Marc Bloch or Lucien Febvre? Has the essence of the historian changed in popular culture but remained the same in academic circles?<br />
	  These are questions that I simply do not know the answer too, although I will try.  I am a simple person, and I believe that the essence of the historian is not necessarily what Mr. Iggers or Mr. Cronan put forth. While these are unique aspects of what a historian can adhere to, for me, the essence of the professional historian is the ability to successfully pass on the past to the present and preserve it for the future. While Iggers addresses this in his final chapter, the face of the historian is changing. We owe much to von Ranke, but we owe equally as much to Herodotus and Thucydides and Homer. They may not have followed the ethos of a professional historian, but they achieved the overarching goal of every professional historian.</p>

					<p>In class we discussed how in today&#8217;s culture it is so easy to access a wide variety of materials and info via the Internet. A person can order almost anything they like, from a set of pens to antiquities, at anytime they like; a person can access a wide variety of information as well as get news reports anytime, anywhere they have Internet access, which with technology like the iPhone and Droid, is nearly worldwide. Many people believe that this unlimited access to so much information is superb, but it has a key drawback; anyone can post what they want as long as they have a site or domain to post what they would like. Numerous high school teachers warn students of taking info from the Internet without careful research because they might get Frankie&#8217;s 6th Grade Project as opposed to Dr. Frankie&#8217;s Scholarly Work. Though the use of sites like JSTOR has enhanced access to scholarly works online, if someone is not careful they may be given the wrong idea about a topic because they did not know any better. The nonstop exposure to information can be overwhelming and, as mentioned in class, may be a contributing factor to the short attention spans many Americans suffer today. The discussion on the key points in time that have changed history was interesting. If you think about it many historians who study Germany are either seeking to explain what happened to lead to Hitler&#8217;s rise and the Holocaust or explaining what has happened since the Third Reich ended. These key history points seem to define the area of study they are involved in because they were so world altering. The Holocaust, The 60&#8242;s, and the End of the Cold War/Fall of the Berlin Wall had such an impact they are used as reference points to earlier or later events. It seems to me a somewhat overly focused when examining events prior to the Holocaust, because leaders had no way of foreseeing the rise of Hitler or the atrocities he would commit. It can be instructive however to see what events lead to the rise of an individual who was able to gain so much power. It can be used to avoid such atrocities in the future if people heed histories&#8217; warnings.

					<p>Last time in class, it was quite interesting to me the conversation we had about whether or not we believe that recent technology and the globalization of today&#8217;s society has broken down the sense of community that was once so prevalent in the past as well as the emphasis of structure versus agency. In my mind there are truths to both sides of these ideas. I think that our sense of community has in most cases has been weakened with the introduction of the rapidly growing monster that is the Internet. The advancements in the way that news is received nowadays provided by the Internet has really changed the way people interact and see the world outside of their own existence. The way it used to be was that news mostly spread through towns from neighbor to neighbor by way of word of mouth, which was a way more intimate and <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">physically</span> interactive way of sharing news. But now all a person has to do is log on to their personal computer in the comfort of their home and the first thing that pops up when they get on to yahoo or <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">AOL</span> or whatever web browser they may be using are endless little news bulletins about current events, politics, sports, weather, etc. This totally routes most other outlets for news like newspapers and word of mouth <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">which</span> usually involve some type of interaction with someone that could be considered apart of your community. Whereas on the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Internet</span> you can do the same thing faster and more effectively without any interaction at all, not to mention the online community spans over language and culture boundaries instead of local communities that newspapers encompass. That being said, maybe that whole idea is not such a negative thing in the sense that it breaks down the community on the local level, because I would say that it builds a community on the global scale and breaks down the barriers of different nations and cultures and brings the world closer together. So whether or not the beast we know as the Internet is good for the community or not it is definitely necessary for our capitalist society to thrive in this age so we must either get used to it or fail to get ahead in <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">today&#8217;s</span> globally aware society.

					<p>Last week we discussed the basics of professionalized history and the questioning of each principle as a result of historical events in the 20th century. For instance the destruction and death caused by World War II and the Holocaust brought into question of modernity and technology’s progress. The Revolutionary 1960s and the 1980s were also destructive. This week we also finished up Igger’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Historiography</span> which goes into great detail of historians&#8217; great questioning of their own practice.</p>
<p>I remember that when I studied abroad in Northern Ireland, I had a teacher who was a renowned as a historian and political scientist. The day he focused on the Marxist interpretation of “the Troubles” in class, he noted that it was only an interesting academic and not a practical way of looking at things since it was discredited in the 1980s. It was amazing to hear him say this and chuckle at the though of it since he based his histories of the Troubles and writings that favored the Union with Britain through a “Neo-Marxist” interpretation.</p>
<p>Some would obviously ask what good are the above professor’s writings then? This is the response one would give if you believed in Francis Fukuyama‘s <span style="font-style: italic;">The End of History</span> (that is Western capitalism is the end all, be all) or the extreme belief in no universal truths or metanarratives called Post-Modernism. While historians have acknowledged that objectivity can not be an achievable goal and have also rejected the tyranny of the metanarrative, the professional pursuit for history has survived such ordeals.</p>
<p>Instead objectivity is a never-ending pursuit for a goal to find a truth as close to what really happened as humanly possible. Metanarratives have given way to a balanced of narratives, structures, and the agency of people. So “discredited” interpretations and historical writings thought to have been “discredited” by the 20th century’s upheavals, should instead be thought as merely focusing on certain parts of history – i.e. just one piece in a larger jig-saw puzzle.

					<p>I finished Iggers &#8220;Historiography in the Twentieth Century&#8221;. I must say I was fascinated by the chapter on German intellectualism. It gave specific examples of how the German intellectual community responded to the mistakes of the German state in the late 1800&#8242;s and the early part of the 20th century. It seems to me that these individuals were unconcerned with advancements in scholarship and more concerned of how the Republic, which financed their livelihoods, would look to the rest of the world if the historical records on were not in concordance with current political apparatus. This anti-development in intellectual thought gives a clearer picture to the rise and escalation of events of the 1930&#8242;s and 40&#8242;s in Germany. If the &#8220;smartest&#8221; among us don&#8217;t realize the problem, and give conscious validation to dirt being swept under the rug, why wouldn&#8217;t a problem like fascism rear its ugly head. Its a scary thought to know that the mechanisms of control can and will blind those who should be responsible for keeping these powers under control, if not stamped out all together. The ideas and customs of the Weimer Republic should have been absent from the intellectual community. Not only for accuracy sake; which all the documents we&#8217;ve read throughout this semester have stressed the importance of accuracy in order to display history to future generations as realistically as possible, but for the sake of academic morality, if you will. Members of the academia should display and act on a higher moral notion than those who deem it their right and responsibility to rule over governments and institutions. As a individual who studies these events in the historical narrative of the 20th century, and especially in the area of the events that led up to the Second World War,  it is my responsibly to act in the interests of the truth and not the interests of an official doctrine.</p>
<p>Speaking of official doctrine, the supreme court, as we highlighted in class, has apparently said that corporations, since they have the same legal rights as individuals are afforded the same rights of free-speech under the US Constitution in matters of campaign financing. Hum? Corporations who are green-lighted by a highly militaristic government. Seems like fascism to me, but I maybe wrong because I don&#8217;t hold a PhD in poly sci from Harvard.  I think it might actually take someone without a PhD in poly sci to see that!!! I&#8217;m honestly vary concerned about this new ruling. Not only because it alienates the individual voter even more from participating in Democrazy (see Peter Colliers book <em>Wars, Guns, and Votes</em>) but on the simpler, much more elementary side: IT GIVES CORPORATIONS THE SAME RIGHTS AS PEOPLE ! (which the Supreme Court already gave away in the last two centuries of stellar judgment) But has deemed in necessary to now give corporations free speech. Ludicrous. I don&#8217;t know if were supposed to express personal opinion on the blogs this much, but to be honest this judgeship makes me sick, worried, and pretty pissed off.</p>

					<p>Last Thursday the Supreme Court ruled that the government cannot forbid political spending by corporations in elections.  The seemingly split court voted 5-4 on a politically charged issue that has angered many Democrats.  This case is another example of the United States placing an emphasis on structure over agency.  The agency of an individual vote is now diminished as whomever has the most money holds the power.  The case also clearly demonstrates language changing reality.</p>
<p>We also talked about the impact of the 24/7 media that has been greatly impacted thanks in large part to technology.  But it is interesting to point out that the industry that first brought about information to the masses is now dying, the newspaper business.  If people still read the newspaper, the majority of people read it online or get their news from blogs.  As soon as some event happens we no longer have to wait until the next day to read about it in the newspaper, we have instant access via television news, internet sites, or even through our cell phones.  As a local example, as soon as Kiffin resigned people were texting me before it even broke on the news.  Several minutes later the story was all over the news and the internet.   Many people seem to think the newspapers are more objective as was Von Ranke’s goal, but they forget about Yellow Journalism.  I think it is harder for people to discern biases in writing compared to television stations such as FOX News or MSNBC.  However the internet holds a negative problem in that anyone can post anything he or she desires, which threatens credibility to numerous sites.  As a historian, one has to be excited about the great advantage that the internet provides in the unlimited amount of archives that are now available.  Capitalism thrives on technology and we are certainly in the technology age.  One can now shop, date, take classes, bank, and on and on the list goes about the things one can do online.   All this access is supposed to make our lives easier by alleviating the stress caused from our hectic schedules, but it seems there is never enough time in the day for some reason.</p>

					<p>During this past class, we discussed several things such as the old and new historian&#8217;s list, technology, and agency vs. structure.  But of those things that I found most interesting, it would have been the new historian guild list.  Between now and von Ranke&#8217;s time, there were many seminal events to take place and I was intrigued by how those events shaped history as a profession.  After reading Iggers and discussing it in class, I understand why von Ranke listed the things he did.  He wanted objectivity and stressed the science part of the study.  But that was a far different time and I was interested on what the end result would be for the profession now.</p>
<p>The three big events that challanged von Ranke&#8217;s list were WWII/Holocaust, the 1960s, and 1989.  Basically, they disputed the notion of the grand narrative, the continuing move toward progress, and discredited one of the major schools of historiography, Marxism, among many other things as well.  The end result of all those things were a new guideline for the profession as outlined by William Cronon.  The important thing is that while it is a new list, it doesn&#8217;t set out to dispute and reject everything that von Ranke said but where he had some good points, refine them to make them better.  Doing so builds upon the work of previous historians rather than breaking the links and trying to start new.</p>
<p>Statements that were kept or just refined were the emphasis on primary sources (that will never change), striving for objectivity with the knowledge that it could never be fully reached, and the use of some narrative form.  But of course there were statements that were rejected like actions demonstrate intentions and the emphasis on scientific ethos.  The new list from Cronon mentions how historians are not looking for generalizable laws since each event in the past was unique and influenced by different things and how history is non-scientific based but evidentiary based.  Cronon&#8217;s list as a whole also illustrates that now, the limitations of the profession are acknowledged and not ignored.  History cannot be truly objective.  It can come close in certain situations but can never be the real thing.  Furthermore, the intentions of actors can not be definitive every single time.  Looking at an action may give an idea of what an actor was thinking but depending on the other information, nothing concrete can be concluded, just an inference but nothing more.  By acknowledging history&#8217;s limitations, it can make the profession better in that people know what to do and what not to do as well as what to expect.</p>
