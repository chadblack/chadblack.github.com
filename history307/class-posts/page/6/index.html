					<p>The amount of material we discussed on Wednesday was immense. The most intriguing topic we discussed was the impact of 24 hour media on the world. The impact is far-reaching on society. This 24 hour monster is just a branch of the internet. The internet has completely changed society. In class, I believe this was well acknowledged. Everything from dating to medical advice is now available via a computer with internet access.</p>
<p>The impact that the 24 hour media has on our culture cannot be stressed enough. Multiple aspects of our culture have changed and disappeared since this media has surfaced. Does the internet really break down our communities? The answer is in a gray area. There is little &#8220;standing by the water cooler&#8221;. Many of these conversations now take place on a message board. This is just one aspect that has been altered. Clearly, newspapers have been damaged. 24 hour media is also spawned by the internet in general. It can be argued that the internet has damaged our communities. It has been well-documented that dating has forever changed. Furthermore, people can shop online and then diagnose themselves in a short period of time. All of these, including our 24 hour media circus, are a product of the internet. The internet in turn is a product of Capitalism. And Capitalism and technology go hand in hand. This is not necessarily saying non-Capitalistic states cannot achieve technology. But when money and personal gain are at the end of a goal, the goal is much more easily reached. As discussed in class, money is a driving force in our community.</p>
<p>The internet has clearly changed our society as a whole. Whether for better or worse, it is a world we must deal with. Though our water-cooler discussions might be an outdated form of communication, our society has also benefited from the internet and technology. The archives are much more accessible than ever before. As learned, archives are the most important aspect of a historian&#8217;s career. Moving on, we are completely saturated with news. The 24 hour news is always looping on multiple channels and can always be accessed via the internet. Is this too much? I believe it is. But our society thrives with excess everything. If one wanders through their cable plan, they discover they has five religious channels, a golf channel, and a few Spanish channels. These, much alike 24 hour news media, are simply not necessary.</p>

					<p>It&#8217;s not very often that a classroom spends a period reflecting on its operations. Perhaps more uncommon is preparing for that reflection with readings. We spoke of Kahn and Freire as we inhabited the world of which they spoke. We were a test case for their theories as we discussed which aspects of their theories we found useful. We had not, and still have not, decided through practice which classroom they describe it is that we will become.<br />
As such, it would have been unreasonable to expect to start our class as Kahn recommends, by sharing our feelings about the day to open up the floor. Maybe that is a bad idea. We had not decided. On the other hand, we did slip into some moments of feeling, his second suggestion on the conduct of the seminar. We also had some tangents which we reincorporated into the discussion. Judging by the look of the posts, the discussion and reading ignited some thought. We all learned. We even had moments of &#8216;barn raising&#8217; within our discussion of what the university&#8217;s function is. On the other hand, our discussion of historiography seemed to me a bit closer to a &#8216;distinguished house tour&#8217;. So, Kahn shows us where we stand.<br />
He also can help us see where we want to go. Why was our historiography discussion weaker than our discussion of what the university does? Part of it was probably reading. As Kahn wrote, thinking about the readings beforehand is essential. Part of it was probably our level of comfort with each other. As Kahn writes, there are many issues of the classroom ranging from the quiet person to the dominating show-off. Personal frictions wear down the building blocks of conversation. However, as one person said as we walked out, he thought people would get more comfortable with each other as we go, leading to more conversation. I think that&#8217;s true. Part of it was the conflict between good person and good student. A good person is cool. A good student is hopelessly interested. Yet the good student learns while the good person remains passive.<br />
Freire help us see how we came to feel this way towards the &#8216;know-it-all showoff&#8217;. In elementary school, this was the student who reveled in being the best suited to being passively filled and regurgitating when appropriate. No wonder we&#8217;re a little grossed out. But if we don&#8217;t fill in the gap between these two roles, the desire to be a good person can keep us from being a good student and, in turn, from knowledge. However, Freire also helps us understand the way to bridge the chasm. In his model the good student&#8217;s interest becomes a social interest, a means of active participation in the world. Knowledge becomes valuable for its utility in freeing a person to participate in their world. The good person and the good student become one. Thus, there are two clear advantages to his system. First, it frees learning. Second, it frees us.<br />
Also, this hints at another reason we could better discuss college than historiography. The first was us. The other was history. These readings, Kahn and Freire, resonate with me because I became a history student because I thought it was a good way to study who we are and why the world exists as it does. Yet it was not for mere curiosity. It was because I felt that this knowledge could be liberating, assuring. I thought that the more I understood, the better I could act as a citizen.<br />
So, here are my two tentative hopes for classes in the future. First, make sure the topic discussed feels relevant to us. I don&#8217;t think this will be any trouble since the class directly concerns what we are doing and becoming. I think this would help us bridge the gap between good person and good student as naturally as when we spoke of our university, leading to better discussions which lead to better ideas. Second, decide what to accept and what to discard from the Kahn piece. Maybe this will be verbal, saying, &#8220;I want to close by reviewing what we did,&#8221; or maybe they will simply be chosen in practice. I don&#8217;t know how we should do this or which things we should keep. However, I think that the utility of using Kahn in analyzing our own discussion points more toward the acceptance of his conclusions than our rejection of them.</p>

					<p>A few months ago, <i>Inside Higher Ed</i> ran <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/05/18/historians" target="_blank">this</a> interview with the co-editors of the recently published book, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Historians-James-Banner-Jr/dp/0226036588/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264444316&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Becoming Historians</a><span style="font-style: normal;">. Its an interesting reflection on the on what drew individuals from an important generation of modern scholarship into the profession, and even more specifically, into the methodological and content subdisciplines they helped define. Both the interview and the book are worth a look.</span></i></p>
<p>I&#8217;m also interested, given our discussion last week and some of your posts in the wake of that discussion, what drew you all to history? Why did you decide to major in History? It&#8217;s certainly not a commitment to economic rationality &#8211; for which I applaud you at this stage of your lives. I&#8217;m not interested in the question, &#8220;What are you going to do with your degree,&#8221; which goes to an aspect of the &#8220;banking model of education.&#8221; Kat mentioned in her <a href="http://kat307.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/stand-back-i%E2%80%99m-doing-history/" target="_blank">post</a> for this week that she &#8220;fell back&#8221; into History after traversing Anthropology and English in part because of the people she&#8217;d encountered in history classes&#8211; both professors and compañeras. What about the rest of you. Gives us a comment below if want.</p>

<p>The readings for the last class were quite illuminating to me, although I cannot say they were entertaining.  From Friere’s excerpt, I found the “banking model” to be interesting, and I enjoyed the conversation about the values and beliefs that the university puts in students, whether it be purposefully or accidentally.  Although it was quite dense, I actually enjoyed the first few chapters from <em>Historiography, </em>especially his explanations of the assumptions historians used in the first historical schools and how those assumptions influenced the final product.</p>
<p>I was very intrigued by the discussion of the values that college impresses into students.  In my opinion, the strongest value that college students learn is the importance of institutions and the necessity of placing themselves into a strong institution.  In high school, I did not care for the application process and only applied to the University of Tennessee because I felt there was little to no difference between universities.  As I started looking into law schools, I heard  about the major distinctions between schools with different rankings and how going to a school with a high ranking would help me advance my career.  Looking back, I believeI was crazy to not apply to at last three or four schools, and I am currently planning to apply to five or six law schools to make sure I get into one with a sufficient ranking.  However, although I have seen how a ranking or the name value of a school affects the perception of myself, I have found little proof that the education given in one law school is radically different from that of another school; they are both still teaching the same subject (law) and striving to prepare a student for the same goal (passing the bar exam.)  Thus, it is not the education that matters in picking a law school; rather, it is the institution I pick when doing so and the name value attached to it through alumni, rankings, and perception.  This is a powerful lesson to most prospective lawyers, and it is reflected in the competition for posts in big name law firms, even though associates at these firms work for 90 to 100 hours a week and spend most of this time doing extremely boring work.  They seek these jobs in order to attach themselves to a strong institution, which they feel will help improve their career</p>
<p>Although I have complaints about the institutionalization of universities and the “banking model,” it is a consequence of our liberal arts education and I do not feel there is much that can be done about it for the majority of classes.  One of the fundamental changes of history in the nineteenth century was professionalization; indeed, all of the social sciences and natural sciences went through a period of professionalization.   This professionalization created institutions, and our modern university is a result of that process.  Furthermore, the “banking model” is necessary for most classes because students are required to take a large number of general education courses, and students do not have enough background information to thoughtfully critique the ideas of others, a necessary component of the seminar.  While it would be nice if my class on Second Temple Judaism were a seminar, I would be unable to contribute to it because i know almost nothing about Judaism.  If a student is required to take calculus, biology, sociology, and religious studies, it is inevitable that there will be a class where they have no knowledge of that subject, and they will ultimately be useless to any seminar done in that class.</p>

					<p>After the last session of class, I realized that I had no clue about exactly what I was getting myself into when I decided to be a History major. I had gone into this department thinking that it all was going to be like what I had enjoyed in high school; learning about history with the teachers basically feeding students the typical story-esque lessons of what happened at D-Day and during the Civil War. I had never really contemplated what I was going to school for or how school was preparing me for my later life. Our &#8220;conversation&#8221;, for lack of a better term, during the recent lecture was a bit of a revelation. The discussion of different theories of how school was using the banking system and the institutionalization of the school system to basically turn young people into drones who are force-fed historical facts and dates without much room for critical thinking or discussion, which in turn leads to people being bred for &#8220;cubicle&#8221; jobs where they take orders and deal with deadlines and so on, led to a lot of reflection on my part. Thinking about this over the weekend has led me to believe that there is a lot of truth behind those theories. I believe they have affected me personally as regards my ability to discuss things intelligently at times. I sometimes find myself in a conversation with someone where I struggle to speak my mind on some aspects of things, fearful of saying something that might be completely wrong or of being corrected by my peers. I believe my apprehension does have a great deal to do with the way the school system is set up. The lack of encouraging individuality and creativity in class did much to hinder me, deep down, when it comes to these facets of learning and life and really contemplating it for the first time has helped me realize some important things. It&#8217;s very self-limiting to believe that speaking up and saying something that may be incorrect is worse than not expressing myself at all in public speaking situations. Although it may still take me a while to be comfortable with opening my mouth and speaking my mind, thinking about it definitely does help me begin to be more open about expressing my thoughts and opinions. On the other side of the argument, I also think we can at times delve too deeply into the belief that schools just teach students how to conform into normal, non-interactive, white-collar jobs. In some cases, I think it is necessary and helpful to provide students with a structured learning environment, to give them a solid educational foundation to build on as their minds mature through college and they begin to develop confidence in expressing their own opinions on different subjects.

					<p>Historiography</p>
<p>By Georg Iggers</p>
<p>Iggers begins his book by briefly highlighting some of the different ways in which history was studied or viewed.  History underwent a change in the nineteenth century to where it became “professionalized. (p.23)”   Previous universities just taught facts and dates, but the new university focused on research.  No longer was the university using teachers who taught a subject they liked as a hobby, but the professors were expected to teach, research, and publish work in their field that they were solely dedicated to.   Leopold Ranke was the first to look at History with an almost scientific approach, he combined his goal of objectivity with the critical method.  Ranke wanted historians to “refrain from judging the past,” instead, “show how things really happened (p.25).”  Karl Lamprecht further questioned this method and had two major focuses:  the role of the state and the focus on people and events.  History soon replaced philosophy as the subject that provided a look at meanings of the world. Max Weber viewed Lamprecht’s ideas published in his book, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Deutsche Geschichte,</span> as “speculative nonsense.”  The Schmoller School held similar assumptions with an emphasis on the central role of the state and the insistence that historical study must keep close to the archival sources (p 36).  This school was used to investigate the conditions of industrial workers for the first time and brought about the foundations for social history.  Weber called for “objectivity and detachment,” because he felt sociology and history were blurring together.  Then a new history developed where Charles Beard saw economic and social conflict as the two decisive factors in American History.   However it was interesting to me that psychology also played a small role in the New History.   As America continued to become the giant melting pot, a new outlook was in place by the New Historians and they became aware of the vast differences that divided the country, while keeping in mind the essentials that worked together to make a national community.  A new understanding of America in the minds of the New Historians proved a contrast to Europe in which America was a, “classless society, free of ideological divisions (p.43).  Another shift was brought about by the New Historians in which they used quantitative methods and applied them to social phenomena (p.43).  Data records were aided by improving technology that allowed behavioral patterns to be studied.  The economy now played a role America’s social and more emphasis was placed on the economy’s role in the social sciences.  One thing that continued to stand out to me throughout the first few chapters was the call to remain impartial and objective.  Too often today our history is influenced by political views or personal tendencies that may distract one from the true meaning.  I think this has become a problem in education, one may have a strong political views expressed throughout a lecture or even throughout the textbook that takes away from the facts.  This is extremely apparent on the news which spin stories to help their conservative or liberal agendas be expressed.</p>

					<p>Regarding some of the discussion last week as to exactly what historians do, and especially the William Cronan essay for this week, I’m left wondering what exactly we are doing here. Historical Research Methods, yes. But how?</p>
<p>As we discovered last week, we aren’t exactly professional historians. Most of us have probably written, at best, a 10 or 20 page research paper as part of our final grade for a class that may not have been our biggest area of interest, using mostly secondary sources and Red Bull as our inspiration. I can’t speak for the rest of the class, but I felt distinctly unprepared talking about the practice of history, and what it meant as a career beyond the undergrad experience of signing up for classes that might motivate me.</p>
<p>The William Cronan and Michael Kahn readings have helped to clarify some of my presence in this class. A former Anthropology major/English minor, I fell back on history because I genuinely enjoyed the classes and my classmates. There’s a love of learning in history classes that I don’t feel consistently in most other disciplines. When I tried to communicate that to my advisor, she said that she felt the same thing. Historians were her favorite teachers, her favorite mentors. It’s a feeling that’s definitely expressed in Cronan’s opening remarks about how historian will be able to identify each other even in a room full of closely related disciplines.</p>
<p>The points Cronan makes about constructive rather than destructive criticism, and mutual respect in academia, work well with Kahn’s evaluation of the seminar, Friere’s condemnation of the narrative, and the move toward an exchange of ideas. That clearly seems to be the direction the class is taking, and I’m intrigued to experience a full-fledged reading seminar and exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, I think there’s a lot to be said for occasional lapses into narration. Again, a large part of me feels wildly unprepared to leap straight into the practice of history, and while I feel that the group exploration of research, writing and revising will be beneficial, I also worry that I don’t have enough knowledge or experience to contribute meaningfully. I worry that without the safety net of a lecturer, the responsibility of understanding the material presented will be crushing.</p>
<p>Likewise, while I find it interesting to probe at connections and threads through history, I worry that narrowing a thesis topic will be excruciatingly difficult, and Cronan highlighted my fears that I might be locked into a topic that could define my entire career. So, while interesting and thought-provoking, I’m already a little terrified at the prospect of actually doing history.</p>

					<p>The banking system that Frieire describes seems to be a fairly accurate assessment of education in our country. Growing up you are taught what the teacher feels is important and there is no room for open discussion on any topic. But I do not feel that this is such a terrible idea for early education. This type of system builds a foundation for the student to continue to build on in the future. Without any prior knowledge, it is difficult to be able to have an intellectual discussion on a subject. When the student is younger it is a time when their brain is a like a sponge ready to absorb the knowledge that is fed to them. This time period, essentially the elementary school years, is a perfect time for this banking system to be used. But once the foundation is there then the educational approach should change. Once the student enters High School it is important to continue their intellectual growth and the best way to accomplish that is to use the system Kahn described, the seminar. Although I do not feel that this system would be as beneficial for all subjects. For instance, it would not work for Math or Science based subjects. Seminars would be best for Humanities, Arts, Psychology, History, etc. These are the type of subjects that can be open to interpretation. In class this week we were asked the difference between Science and History, and in my opinion the major difference is that History is more open to the student&#8217;s own interpretation of the material. Sure facts are facts but a person can interpret why a historical event occurred in anyway they see fit, as long as they can come up with some research to back up their claims. Research is also needed in Science, but to turn your theory into fact there are many hurdles to overcome. I just feel that it&#8217;s easier to make a claim in History and be able to adequately back it up. Now back to the subject of the transition from the banking system to the seminar. A major hurdle here is changing culture of the classroom and everything that the student is used to. In elementary education it seems that a student is considered smart if they can answer the teacher&#8217;s questions. But at the same time some students are too shy to speak up, or maybe think it would be socially unbecoming to look like &#8220;nerd&#8221;. This perception might make it harder to gain friends during this time period. And at this stage of childhood one of the most important things is being able to make, and keep, friends. Students need to be taught that intellectual ability should not be looked down on. If these problems can be overcome then the students can have a very enlightening High School career that sets them up well for higher education in college. Therefore I feel that we need to use both of these systems in our quest for improved education. As long as they are both used in the right way then the students could be better prepared for higher education and, eventually, the real world.</p>

					<p>The readings for the past class I found to be very interesting and sort of changed my thinking in relation to my classes, maybe not so much in how I understand what is taught in them but how I see each class in general.  This might seem odd since the readings didn’t seem to have anything groundbreaking but in addition to be a History major, I am also an Accounting major so talking about the banking method of teaching for classes is more relevant to me.</p>
<p>Reading Freire’s defintion of the banking method that the teacher deposits information and “the students patiently receive, memorize, and repeat” is pretty much a great description of my business classes that I take.  When I am taught a way to solve a particular accounting problem, I memorize the steps and repeat them as necessary for all future problems without really thinking why that is the best way or even why it works.  Just knowing that it works is good enough for me.  It’s like that in other business subjects, if there is a problem X, then use solution Y or maybe solution Z.  Of course, the banking method does sort of work in the case of Accounting in that the stuff I learn now is supposed to help me down the road with the CPA exam, which is professional certification.  But that even is an example of just studying only the things on the test and doesn&#8217;t help me with things that won&#8217;t be on it.</p>
<p>The real problem with the banking concept is not necessarily how students learn but that it creates a check-mark system which can grow into areas other than just education.  And by check-mark system I mean, whether or not you meet some qualification or have some basic ability to do something.  I have experienced that a lot especially when interacting with Accounting firms.  Every firm that I have talked to has mentioned that I need to be a member of Accounting society because that shows them I am well rounded.  Every time I hear that I cringe because being a member doesn’t necessarily mean anything other than fulfilling the basic requirements of going to the Wednesday meeting and proctoring certain exams.  That example goes along well with the discussion in class about the expectations associated with college and how it is assumed you can do certain things while those who don’t go to college cannot.</p>
<p>These assumptions can tie into the Iggers discussion about Ranke.  He explained that Ranke valued objectivity extremely high and said it was essential.  But in addition to that, he showed how Ranke viewed events and people in vacuums.  In doing so he neglected to show an interest in the movements and thinking of the time period he was studying.  He missed possible answers of why someone acted the way they did or what underlying set of beliefs led them.  Like Ranke, the check-mark system can have a similar effect when looking at job applicants because by emphasizing a narrow list of things, you can easily miss out on important and significant experience or activities someone may have that would bolster their credentials and make them a far better fit for the job.</p>
<p>Finally with Kahn’s statements, it really is difficult in my experience to have a true barn-raising seminar.  Too often it starts out as a free-for-all where a select few care and strive to outdo each other while the others just don’t care.  That leads to what I think is the biggest problem with seminars and that is the reputation they have developed.  The reputation of being a free-for-all or for show-offs only is the problem inherent in them.  When a large chunk of the students don’t care or don’t want to be embarrassed by someone telling them they are stupid, it becomes difficult to have an enjoyable, enriching seminar.  When the students go in there looking to learn and develop an idea they have, it can be a real success.  In order to have a barn raised, everyone needs to lift or else the barn may never get built.</p>

					<p>This week&#8217;s discussion largely revolved around the difference between standard classroom and the concept of the seminar. While we have previously suffered under a mundane &#8220;banking system&#8221; of learning, memorizing “In 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue&#8221; did not turn us into uncreative and brainwashed zombies. After all wasn&#8217;t most of our schooling meant to just be a basic foundation for us to later build on?</p>
<p>This memorization of dates and names has led many to think of history as merely the boring events of &#8220;great men&#8221; and nations in the arena of politics and wars. As shown in the first section of Georg G. Iggers&#8217; Historiography of the Twentieth Century, this negative description of history exactly described historical publications in the 19th century. </p>
<p>As part of the school of Historicism, most 19th century historians solely focused on individuals in power and the political and military struggles of Western nations. Under the guise of scientific research and authority, they scoured archives where they cherry picked sources to support their personally held nationalist, racial, and ideological convictions. This obviously led to a neglecting of other aspects of history and the history of other nations and peoples.</p>
<p>Ironically, Leopold Ranke, the man who greatly contributed to this development was also one of the founders of modern historical research. According to Ranke, history was to be a trustworthy reconstruction of the past. History&#8217;s writing further needed to be done by specialists that sought the objective truth but for an educated public. Thus history was to serve as both as a branch of science and a cultural source for society. He further added that historians should not judge events and should merely state what happened.</p>
<p>It is Ranke’s understanding of what history is and the purpose of the professional historian that has been more or less the standard for the profession of history. The legacy of Historicism including the questioning of history’s “science” and Ranke’s standards of history and the historian will probably be in the back of everyone’s mind in History 307 as the semester progresses.

					<p>The process of history is much more complex than one would think. Last class session really highlighted this for me. The way history is typically taught in school systems does not stretch a student&#8217;s mind and requires small amounts of actual thinking. From my experiences, I have learned that coaches pass out a workbook and tell you do to &#8220;x&#8221; and &#8220;y&#8221; exercises. This material is forgotten within days and definitely forgotten after the test. Interaction between students is direly important in order to garner critical thinking. Questions must be posed and answered thoughtfully. These are all reasons why the banking system does not challenge students. Whether the banking system readies students for a working environment in today&#8217;s society is up for debate. Different jobs require different traits. The banking system <em>does</em> ready students for a &#8220;cubicle-type&#8221; job. Memorization of specific dates in history requires zero critical thinking. Teaching these dates are pointless and do not challenge students. Timeline history should be replaced with history that requires students to think and analyze certain topics. A topic discussed during last class that stuck with me was the topic of self-sense while history is occurring. For instance, did a soldier during the storming of Normandy understand his importance on history. This topic requires abstract thinking. The impact might not be realized until far after the actual event. This is a prime example of requiring a student to think. When students actively think, the interaction with one another helps thoughts flow freely. We all learn from each other and an interactive classroom setting helps all of us to learn. Problem solving encourages this interaction. The banking system encourages students to finish their work and keep to one another. This is a cycle in the schooling I have experienced. It is much easier for a teacher to pass out worksheets and ask the students to complete the exercises quietly. An underpaid teacher could very well take this route and call it a day. But it is important to the future of learning that students actively think and problem solve. A &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; is rarely found. But tossing a subject around while critically thinking cannot be replaced by a workbook. The workbook needs to be replaced by problem solving and thought-provoking interaction between classmates.</p>

					<p>Kahn&#8217;s &#8220;The Seminar&#8221; was a very well structured example of how structured our, well some folks, approach to academic discourse has become almost a cat and mouse game. Who can get the mouse/idea the fastest without any real thought to other peoples ideas, whether those ideas are helpful or not. &#8220;The Seminar&#8221; showed for excellent examples of the way groups and individuals approach the idea of discourse. As well discussed in class, and as we&#8217;ve all seen throughout our academic careers, many people in the learning world, from student to teacher to researcher, the sharing and critique of ideas has become somewhat of a touchy subject due to perceived and actual attitudes towards information one dreams as original or if I may use this metaphor, an idea that is like the holy grail. If you have it, bring it, or find it first your top dog. As I hope to realize through this course is that peer review and critique is essential in not only making sure your ideas are coherent and correct, but so that you have the opportunity for others to be able to expound on my ideas and vise-versa.</p>
<p>Friere&#8217;s text &#8220;Pedagogy of The Oppressed&#8221; touched at the heart of some ideas I&#8217;ve had about our current educational system, but wasn&#8217;t really able to nail down as clearly as Friere did. Friere showed that natural curiosity is being thrown from the train in order to make room for a domination policy that has been present in education since big biz began to stick its dirty little fingers in all the educational pies. Can people learn if curiosity is deemed dangerous because only new idea should stem from the banking model. And if indeed they are new ideas not regurgitated facts or technology given a new coat of paint, they should not deviant from the model as to disrupt the order of Things.</p>
<p>I bought Iggers book &#8220;Historiography in the 20th Century&#8221; today and read a few chapters. I&#8217;m quite intrigued as to the original centralization of academics around the State during the early 19th century, apparently any challenge other was a &#8220;violation of the historical spirit&#8221;. It took the fun lovin&#8217; French to encompass the nature of historical acquirement and get the Germans from being so German about things. I did like however that Ranke, in the search for history to be more scientific and acurate, threw out all secondary account of the history of  the Italian Wars. This seems like a major challenegd he faced as a founding father of modern historical research.</p>

					<p>A couple of things struck me about the Iggers reading. The first was the fact that history didn&#8217;t emerge as a professional discipline until the early nineteenth century.  I never realized this was the case. I&#8217;ve been exposed for so long to histories written before that time&#8211;classical Roman histories, the British histories of Hume and Gibbon, the early histories of the French Revolution studied by Marx, and so on&#8211;that I always implicitly assumed that history had been one of the academic disciplines for more or less as long as there had been academic disciplines. Iggers devoted extremely little space to discussion of history as practiced before Ranke, and I would be interested to hear more about the way history was viewed by academia before that time&#8211;for example, how David Hume, as an academic, conceived of his project in writing a history of Britain and how that conception differs from a nineteenth or twentieth century professional historian going about the same task, not in terms of methodology but in terms of the intended place of the work in academic literature.</p>
<p>The other thing that struck me was the concept of history as a discourse defined by certain methodologies rather than as an attempt at a &#8216;true story,&#8217; so to speak.  As a philosophy major who&#8217;s studied primarily twentieth century thought, I&#8217;ve had a lot of exposure to post-structuralist ideas about discourse and writing, and much of this thought has been very influential on me (particularly Foucault, but also Derrida and other thinkers with a more limited political scope like Laclau and Mouffe). I accept a lot of these ideas, or at least find them useful, but I guess I had just never thought about historical writing in these terms.  Not to say that I have been uncritical of notions of historical &#8216;truth&#8217; or that I&#8217;ve ever accepted anything like a correspondence theory of truth, as a history major I&#8217;ve had plenty of cause to think about these things, but the application of discourse theory in particular to history, for whatever reason, is not something I&#8217;ve ever thought about and that notion (suggested by the overview discussion in the introduction to the Iggers book, I guess, as I haven&#8217;t got to the third section yet) struck me as really cool. Makes me wish I had time to explore some of the post-structuralist-ish texts Iggers refers to in that introduction! Some day I will do so.

					<p>Our <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">discussion</span> this week was very enlightening I had never thought about the processes students go through or to what end they served. The banking system, or the financial system, molds students into cookie-cutter models in order to quietly sit and work in the system of American <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">business</span>. I had never thought about the way in which people were taught or that anything was wrong with the &#8220;this happened at this time&#8221; method of history. Getting really into the idea of thinking why a certain event happened and what effect it had on future events and how the events relate to modern people is far more useful than merely knowing the facts such as, William the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Conqueror</span> invaded the British Isles in 1066. The knowledge of this date alone does nothing for an individual unless they find themselves asked for it on an obscure game show. What is important is not that William invaded in 1066 but rather what this invasion led to and what affect it had on England and the politics of the time. The problem solving method of history pushes the student to break out of the machine of society and actually question why it is important to understand the topic which he is attempting to study and what he can add to society beyond the simple paper pushing of cubicle life. I think it is important to look past events from the problem solving angle because the past can help us not only understand what our forefathers have gone through but how the events of the past effect us. Learning about the past in an engaged forum allows the student to not only learn the material but to understand what he has learned and formulate his own point of view aside from merely rehashing what he has been told to memorize. The problem solving method allows people to think for themselves, rather than becoming drones. It engages the students so that there is active participation rather than utter silence. as we saw in class Wednesday, the banking system encourages students to stay quite than rather risking looking dumb by speaking their mind.

					<p>The readings for the last class were quite illuminating to me, although I cannot say they were entertaining.  From Friere&#8217;s excerpt, I found the &#8220;banking model&#8221; to be interesting, and I enjoyed the conversation about the values and beliefs that the university puts in students, whether it be purposefully or accidentally.  Although it was quite dense, I actually enjoyed the first few chapters from <em>Historiography, </em>especially his explanations of the assumptions historians used in the first historical schools and how those assumptions influenced the final product.</p>
<p>I was very intrigued by the discussion of the values that college impresses into students.  In my opinion, the strongest value that college students learn is the importance of institutions and the necessity of placing themselves into a strong institution.  In high school, I did not care for the application process and only applied to the University of Tennessee because I felt there was little to no difference between universities.  As I started looking into law schools, I heard  about the major distinctions between schools with different rankings and how going to a school with a high ranking would help me advance my career.  Looking back, I believeI was crazy to not apply to at last three or four schools, and I am currently planning to apply to five or six law schools to make sure I get into one with a sufficient ranking.  However, although I have seen how a ranking or the name value of a school affects the perception of myself, I have found little proof that the education given in one law school is radically different from that of another school; they are both still teaching the same subject (law) and striving to prepare a student for the same goal (passing the bar exam.)  Thus, it is not the education that matters in picking a law school; rather, it is the institution I pick when doing so and the name value attached to it through alumni, rankings, and perception.  This is a powerful lesson to most prospective lawyers, and it is reflected in the competition for posts in big name law firms, even though associates at these firms work for 90 to 100 hours a week and spend most of this time doing extremely boring work.  They seek these jobs in order to attach themselves to a strong institution, which they feel will help improve their career</p>
<p>Although I have complaints about the institutionalization of universities and the &#8220;banking model,&#8221; it is a consequence of our liberal arts education and I do not feel there is much that can be done about it for the majority of classes.  One of the fundamental changes of history in the nineteenth century was professionalization; indeed, all of the social sciences and natural sciences went through a period of professionalization.   This professionalization created institutions, and our modern university is a result of that process.  Furthermore, the &#8220;banking model&#8221; is necessary for most classes because students are required to take a large number of general education courses, and students do not have enough background information to thoughtfully critique the ideas of others, a necessary component of the seminar.  While it would be nice if my class on Second Temple Judaism were a seminar, I would be unable to contribute to it because i know almost nothing about Judaism.  If a student is required to take calculus, biology, sociology, and religious studies, it is inevitable that there will be a class where they have no knowledge of that subject, and they will ultimately be useless to any seminar done in that class.</p>
