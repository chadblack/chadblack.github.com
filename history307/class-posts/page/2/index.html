					<p>This is kind of a random post, but as we&#8217;re entering into crunch time regarding thesis topics and buckling down for a year-long commitment, I came to the sudden realization that I was not doing any of this because I had genuinely thought &#8220;wow, how cool, this is something I want to do!&#8221; Instead, I kept thinking about it in terms of &#8220;this is the next step.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t doing anything &#8211; looking at thesis topics, looking at grad schools &#8211; because of what I specifically wanted.</p>
<p>That was a really good moment for me (occurring all of half an hour ago), because it really unexpectedly helped me to calm down, take a step back and think about what I want to explore and why.</p>
<p>So out of curiosity, why are you all in this class? I know some of you are double majoring, some are planning to go to law school, and some of you are probably looking into this whole &#8220;professional historian&#8221; thing like me because you feel more connected to history than any other discipline. What are you all hoping to get out of this thesis project? Why history honors? Where do you want to go from here?</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;m just curious because it seems like such an obvious thing &#8211; why are you a history major? &#8211; but it was one that I really hadn&#8217;t given enough thought to recently.</p>

					<p>I really appreciated the discussion this week over &#8220;bias&#8221; as it relates to cultural relativism. (Even though I&#8217;m always the jerk who &#8220;plays devil&#8217;s advocate&#8221; and brings up things like female genital mutilation, I&#8217;m always intrigued by cultural differences and the explorations thereof.) And while I&#8217;m still a little confused about the Nahua customs and meaning the opposite of what they say, it certainly gave me a new perspective on the conquest of the Americas.</p>
<p>For that matter, every history class I&#8217;ve taken has had a very different way of approaching it. In my intensive &#8220;History of the Americas&#8221; course in high school, we watched several taped lectures from Marshall Eakin, a Latin Americanist at Vanderbilt, who seemed interested in the different colonial styles of various European nations and also in American pre-history. A major theme was that it wasn&#8217;t necessarily a case of one cultural power eclipsing another, but a meeting of two great cultural powers. (There was probably a lot more, but I missed most of that unit.) Then I took a course when I was studying in Wales on genocide that presented the colonization as such, an admission you won&#8217;t hear from most Americans (and certainly not in the public schools.) It goes to show that there are at least as many views on the cultural collision now as there were at the time, and kind of plays in to what we&#8217;ve been talking about in the background these past few weeks: how different historians can choose to emphasize certain aspects of their work.</p>
<p>And because this is another late post and I ramble frequently, and because this is a free post, I&#8217;m going to talk about that for a minute: how do our interests, perspectives, and backgrounds influence the kind of history we do?</p>
<p>I mentioned last week that I&#8217;m really interested in microhistory and the &#8220;history of the local,&#8221; and that&#8217;s true. I would also consider myself much more interested in social and cultural history (and how prevailing attitudes play out in contemporary cultural representations, as with early cinema or fifties pulp novels), and I have a definite fascination with religion/religious dogma/interaction between church and state, as well as a fascination with gender and sexuality/perspectives thereof. Does this play into what I research on my own time? Of course it does. When selecting books for a class on medieval history, I choose things with titles like &#8220;Marriage and the Cloister: Women in Frankish Society, 500-900.&#8221; My essay for a class on Modern Italy focused on the female emigration experience, while my project for the same class was about how Mussolini incorporated the Catholic Church into his systems of fascism. And I actually found all of the above interesting, which probably makes some of you political or military historians want to stab yourself with a fork.</p>
<p>As I struggle to define a clear thesis topic and also figure out what the hell comes after all this, it&#8217;s comforting to know what I enjoy, what type of history I might do, and what my focal points will be if I really do spend my life doing this.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not even going to touch Che Guevara this week.</p>

					<p>The <em>Views on the Conquest </em>seemed to be the middle ground that took into account the various points of views on what happened during the Conquest.  There were initial claims of friendship, but the 17<sup>th</sup> chapter included an account of Montezuma being seized followed by the Spaniards looting, raping, and killing anyone and anything in their path.  Smallpox also soon followed which devastated the tribes, on top of the continuous attacks of the Spaniards who captured and sold the natives into slavery.  The terminology used to describe Tenochtitlan really made it seem grand when terms such as magnificent, spacious, and astounding.  They tried to relate it to places they had seen such as the stone bridges, but they cannot fully describe the city because they have never seen anything like it.  Their own biases interfere here mainly because they do not know any better.  The Bernal Diaz account told a different story of the Cortes and Montezuma meeting.  According to Diaz both men were very cordial towards each other and Montezuma gave Cortes flowers and numerous necklaces to signal his friendship to which Cortes responded by stroking Montezuma’s hair.  Diaz said there were over 400,000 conversions of the natives.  In the native account the women fought in place of their dead husbands against the conquistadors, while the Spanish documents mainly omit women from their accounts.  Dona Maria was a central figure in the events as she served as Cortes’ translator.  In one artists’ rendering she is placed in the middle of the meeting of Cortes and Montezuma which signified the importance of her presence.  This was rare for a woman to be given so much significance.  Also in the drawing Montezuma is shown with a beard, but the natives did not have facial hair.  The beard was power symbol for the Spanish and when the artist painted Montezuma with a beard it showed his importance and also how the artist could not avoid his own biases.  Another intriguing section from the reading was when Hernando Pizzaro was imprisoned in Spain.  He wrote a letter to his priest in which he was very confident of his innocence, and plotted to get money smuggled into Spain to frame his dead brother.  This letter was somewhat humorous implying that the priest served as his bookie, if you will.</p>

					<p>I had a chance to talk to Dr. Black after class last week. During our conversation he asked me a question that I had often wondered the answer to myself. This is a paraphrase but I think it was along the lines of: even though East Tennessee had units fighting for the North during the Civil War, why does this region in particular identify itself with Southern Pride culture? As I&#8217;ve said, this was a question that has been my mind for a while as well. My response was that even though the units from East Tennessee had fought with the North, Reconstruction follies and the reemergence of white supremacy organizations such as the Ku Klux Klowns pre and post World War I, which remained highly popular up in till the 70&#8242;s has deeply influenced the rise of Southern pride culture in East Tennessee. While my initial answer satisfied conversational requirements, it didn&#8217;t quell my curiosity on the subject. Nor did it really get to the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>When the semester started I was thinking I wanted to write about how folkways music (work-songs, hoolies, spirituals, and English ballads) transitioned into the blues and the social and cultural changes that caused the switch, but as I&#8217;ve mentioned in class primary sourcing on such a topic is very hard to come by due to education levels and would leave me to speculate, at least for this project, rather than make educated realizations and be able to tell the story accurately from a first hand account. Of late I have been focusing on the year 1919, which was critical and pivotal year for post-war America and which involves the first red scare and dozens of race riots known as the &#8220;Red Summer&#8221;. On a side note: Knoxville even experienced a race riot during this time.</p>
<p>Immediately after I had answered Dr. Black&#8217;s question, I realized how a lot of what we know in popular culture as &#8220;Southern Pride&#8221; comes from around this time. The question as well as may &#8220;current&#8221; topic have afforded me the opportunity to tackle my long held curiosity of race relations, southern culture and the rise of Southern pride movements. As a student of sociology and history this a great opportunity to understand the mindset and reasoning behind groups like the Klowns and the long held ideas of a southern rebellious nature that is present in East Tennessee.</p>
<p>I wrote this in hoping, because it’s a freebie week that some of you could comment on the types of topics you are hopefully going to be tackling over the course of this honors history program.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m really tempted to comment on the discussion that has already started about Che, but I think I&#8217;ll wait til after the class where we discuss the readings on Che to do so in detail&#8211;unless I am confused about what was discussed in the last class. I wasn&#8217;t there, but according to the syllabus the discussion should have been on the conquest of Mexico, correct? And this week should be Che? Also, is it this week and next that are being switched on the syllabus (making this the week off and next week the Che discussion)?</p>
<p>Anyway, I do want to comment on the idea of not taking sides during the Cold War and the association of Che&#8217;s beliefs with the Soviet side of that &#8216;war.&#8217; I think it&#8217;s very misleading to think of the Cold War as an ideological battle between capitalism or democracy (or &#8220;freedom&#8221; if you&#8217;re nauseatingly idealistic enough to phrase it that way) and communism. It was a struggle for hegemony between two world powers, neither of which was truly guided by an ideology that it thought was best for the common folk. Both the US and the USSR were imperialist powers motivated by the desire for more power. Much of the rhetoric of the Cold War, from both sides, was just propaganda intended for domestic political benefit. The US is as terrible an example of democracy as the USSR is of communism. We should view both as historically situated powers with a political agenda, not as proxies for contrasting political projects.</p>
<p>The contradictions here are particularly striking when you realize that the supposed justification for &#8220;battling communism,&#8221; namely to preserve freedom and democracy, was the same justification for the struggles of Che and other Latin American revolutionaries. Arguably, the Cuban Revolutionaries were genuine about this project and the US military was not. Che and co. were not waging a revolutionary war to support the Soviet side of an international struggle, they were waging a war against oppression and imperialism and fighting for freedom and equality. The record of post-revolutionary Cuba is of course mixed, as is the record of every nation in the history of the world, but overall the revolution brought a dramatic increase in the standard of living as well as the level of freedom, equality, and democracy for Cubans. This improvement is especially staggering when you consider the massive efforts by the West to prevent the project from succeeding. To suddenly have what used to be your most important trading partner, and all of that partner&#8217;s allies, suddenly cut off all relations, and still to effect dramatic improvements, is downright remarkable. Props to Fidel.</p>
<p>When Marx was writing in the mid and late nineteenth century, he was doing so in opposition to cruelty and oppression and with the aim of creating a better society in which workers&#8211;meaning, ideally, all people&#8211;would not be ruled over by a tyrannical few but would share power and resources more or less equally. The phrase &#8220;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8221; refers to the joint rule of the entire working class, not to a single dictator who is supposed to rule in lieu of said working class. Sad, then, that we now simply dismiss this alternative vision to capitalism by pointing to the Soviet Union&#8211;a political entity on the opposite end of the spectrum from most everything Marx stood for&#8211;and saying &#8220;look, that didn&#8217;t work.&#8221; Of course it didn&#8217;t work, but it didn&#8217;t work because the revolution was betrayed and turned into a corrupt authoritarian regime. That&#8217;s a failure of tyranny, not of communism. The Cuban case is similar in that it resulted in the rule of a single leader, but unlike Stalin, Castro was repeatedly elected by overwhelming majorities and, also unlike Stalin, Castro&#8217;s rule dramatically improved the conditions for the people of his country (excepting, of course, those people who had previously been the exploiters and who now live in luxury in the US and complain about the evils of the revolutionary regime in Cuba). We should be skeptical of all centralized power and not let revolutionaries off the hook for their fuck ups just because they wave the right flag, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it makes sense to conflate any given revolutionary project with the Soviet Union just because the word &#8220;communism&#8221; has been applied to both. That&#8217;s far from a fair treatment of independent historical subjects.

This improvement is especially staggering when you consider the massive efforts by the West to prevent the project from succeeding. To suddenly have what used to be your most important trading partner, and all of that partner&#8217;s allies, suddenly cut off all relations, and still to effect dramatic improvements, is downright remarkable. Props to Fidel.</p>
<p>When Marx was writing in the mid and late nineteenth century, he was doing so in opposition to cruelty and oppression and with the aim of creating a better society in which workers&#8211;meaning, ideally, all people&#8211;would not be ruled over by a tyrannical few but would share power and resources more or less equally. The phrase &#8220;dictatorship of the proletariat&#8221; refers to the joint rule of the entire working class, not to a single dictator who is supposed to rule in lieu of said working class. Sad, then, that we now simply dismiss this alternative vision to capitalism by pointing to the Soviet Union&#8211;a political entity on the opposite end of the spectrum from most everything Marx stood for&#8211;and saying &#8220;look, that didn&#8217;t work.&#8221; Of course it didn&#8217;t work, but it didn&#8217;t work because the revolution was betrayed and turned into a corrupt authoritarian regime. That&#8217;s a failure of tyranny, not of communism. The Cuban case is similar in that it resulted in the rule of a single leader, but unlike Stalin, Castro was repeatedly elected by overwhelming majorities and, also unlike Stalin, Castro&#8217;s rule dramatically improved the conditions for the people of his country (excepting, of course, those people who had previously been the exploiters and who now live in luxury in the US and complain about the evils of the revolutionary regime in Cuba). We should be skeptical of all centralized power and not let revolutionaries off the hook for their fuck ups just because they wave the right flag, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it makes sense to conflate any given revolutionary project with the Soviet Union just because the word &#8220;communism&#8221; has been applied to both. That&#8217;s far from a fair treatment of independent historical subjects.

					<p>Through the three different primary sources we read in class, we were able to see three very different perspectives on the motives, thoughts, and even actions in the Spanish conquest of Mexico.  One of the most important lessons that we learned is that language is a limitation to what a person is able to communicate through written material.  This can be seen most evidently in the description of Tenochtitlan given by Bernal Diaz del Castillo.  He uses words such as causeways and &#8220;cities and villages built on the water&#8221; to describe a style of city building that was absolutely foreign to him and all Spainards.  While it bears some similarities to Venice, the city of Tenochtitlan, a city built on a drained lake, was totally unique.  Adding to its grandeur was the fact that it was the largest city in the world.  Thus, we can see the sense of wonder from a Spainard&#8217;s eyes towards the city of Tenochtitlan, but it is difficult to get a true description of the city because he is describing it from a European perspective.  From his description, it would be possible to imagine a city much like Venice, even though Tenochtitlan was nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>I guess I need to get my Che opinion out of the way, even though it is not the most informed opinion in the world.  I am probably one of the few truly ambivalent people towards Che. On one hand, he truly believed in his political doctrine more than anyone obvious example in recent history; I cannot think of another person who fought for their beliefs against such daunting odds over and over again, from Guatemala to Cuba to Angola to Bolivia.  On the other hand, I happen to disagree with said political doctrine, even though I also disagree with the political doctrines of his enemies at the time (I would have definitely been a member of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War).  So, I am interested in reading more about him, even though I look at any documents from the CIA with a very wary eye.</p>

					<p>Since there isn&#8217;t a set topic for this week&#8217;s blog, my post will basically be a rant or something of the sort.</p>
<p>First of all, I know this is random but I highly recommend that some of you check out the blog &#8220;Civil War Memory&#8221; at cwmemory.com . What is so great about this blog (written by a high school history teacher) is that on a regular basis it destroys the popular myth of the &#8220;Black Confederate&#8221; by examining historical cases emphasized and promoted by modern day Lost Cause &#8220;historians.&#8221; The blog&#8217;s owner and other contributors find that the sources used in these cases are falsified or altered. For instance the wording of a Freed African-American in 1861 describing his two sons &#8220;serving in the army&#8221; is misinterpreted. Their roles are assumed to be the same as other men in the same unit &#8211; fighting soldiers. However the majority of the &#8220;Black Confederates&#8221; turn out to have been laborers, cooks, or enslaved servants of white soldiers. Even though this is an extreme case, its interesting to read how such myths are constructively destroyed step by step.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also looking forward to reading about Che Guevera&#8217;s death even though I have been largely indifferent to the topic of him over the years. Perhaps the cult of Che and the realities of communism has turned me off in the past? Personally my favorite dead commie is Tito of Yugoslavia. Anyways, I&#8217;m interested in learning more about the man than the icon but am very skeptical of any writings on him.

					<p>The failure and limitations of language that we discussed during last class is something that in normal, everyday life occurs more than most realize.  Saying the opposite of what you actually mean to someone you just met, like the Aztecs did with Cortes, seems absurd now but it isn&#8217;t really different from saying things either jokingly or sarcastically to someone whom you just met too.  They likely will see you as serious unless you tell them otherwise after the fact.  You act normally until you realize that doing so creates problems.  I know when I came here, jokes and comments I made were those I made back home but here people didn&#8217;t understand what I meant so I dropped doing them altogether rather than explaining the joke, thus ruining it.  You can&#8217;t expect everyone to know what you mean and that fact  is sometimes slow to be realized.  Being on the other end of those kinds of failed jokes can be even worse if the person blames you for not getting it or understanding it was a joke in the first place.  Someone that I barely know is someone whom I will take at face value, unless it is clear that the person isn&#8217;t being serious.  But if something is said with a straight face, you can&#8217;t assume that the person is joking or being ironic.  The limitations of language is also something that creeps into conversations far more than is realized.  Just thinking about stories I have told, there have been numerous examples of explaining something in terms that helps the person listening better understand.  I may say &#8220;sort of like the lecture hall underneath the McClung Museum&#8221; whenever I talk about being in an underground auditorium/lecture hall somewhere other than UTK.  Describing what the place actually looked like probably isn&#8217;t going to be nearly as useful to the listener than by just saying it&#8217;s like a place the listener knows.  I know listening to someone&#8217;s story, if I can&#8217;t visualize it or have some reference point, it&#8217;s going to be harder to understand just exactly what was going on or what it was like.  Just as in good writing, when speaking, you need to know your audience.  Otherwise, people can get the wrong impression and conclude things you didn&#8217;t actually mean.  That isn&#8217;t helpful to anyone.</p>

					<p>The conquest of Mexico by the Spanish Conquistadors reads differently depending on which source an individual reads. the source from the Spanish show that the forces of Montezuma attacked the Spanish first, rather than being the defending party. the work The Spaniards Entry into Tenochtitlan is very interesting as well as humorous. the writing is humorous in that if the reader takes certain gifting ceremonies out of context of the time and place, and especially the culture, then it makes Hernan Cortes and Montezuma look very homosexual. however the giving of gifts in the form of necklaces and copious amounts of flowers, and more than anything the holding of hands and caressing of hair. though i do not currently understand the customs that allow a man to hold an other&#8217;s hand while caressing his hair and still be considered completely heterosexual, i do understand that that is the case in the reading. from the readings i understand that the Spanish worked their way into Mexica society through gifts and the translating aid of Dona Maria. dona maria was the name generally used by the Mexica to refer to Cortes because she was his voice in the Mexica society. she is given very much respect in the drawings of Mexica/Spanish interactions. she is shown as speaking as well as shown not neutral or Mexica but close to the Spanish side of the landscape. she is given prominence also because rather than unclothed as the Mexica are shown she wears a full dress. she was also mother of the first mestizo children by Cortes himself. the Spanish view of the new world is the same as that of the Europeans who take control of North America; can we survive here, are there resources, and can we tame the savages. it is pathetic how the ethnocentric view has destroyed so many rich and colorful cultures which could have easily survived till today had Europeans worked alongside the natives rather than sought to eradicate them or subjugate them. the history of foriegn interactions with the European powers is appallingly pathetic and destructive.

					<p>As I am writing this, I am under the impression that this weeks topic is completely up to us. If so, I will avoid blogging about Moctezuma and the Spanish Conquest. While I can understand these topics are very interesting to some, I cannot say I am remotely interested in either. Rather, I am somewhat excited to tackle the interesting topic of the death of Che Guevara. Not many people are as interesting as Guevara and his multiple revolution attempts.</p>
<p>I have read several books regarding Guevara and I am fascinated by his life as a whole. While reading, I attempt to read authors with varying opinions of Guevara&#8217;s life. Tackling the challenge of Jon Lee Anderson&#8217;s biography is a tall task. If anything, Anderson definitely did his homework and wrote a thorough biography of any and most information he could garner regarding Guevara. On the other hand, I read another book by Humberto Fontova. Fontova does not reach nearly the intellectual level of Anderson on any facet of his anti-Che Guevara book. While Anderson&#8217;s biography seems much more respectable, Fontova does happen to have been born in Cuba at the time of the Cuban Revolution. To say he is anti Castro and Guevara is a severe understatement. He views Guevara as a murderer and liar. He claims that Guevara never received his Doctoral degree from any institution. While I am no means an expert on the subject, I would say Fontova is overreaching at times. Guevara graduated from the University of Buenos Aires quite a long time ago and I could not be confident that paperwork could be simply lost.</p>
<p>To the testament that Guevara is a murderer, I would have to agree. But agreeing to this fact is such a broad stroke of the brush. Guevara was a &#8220;professional revolutionist&#8221;. I would not expect him to be a peaceful ambassador to half the world. Much like General Cornwallace or President George Washington, he participated in a revolution to further a cause he felt was just. Though this cause happens to be the much misused term of Communism and/or Socialism, it was what Guevara thought as just. Coming from Guevara&#8217;s background, I understand why he would believe in the concepts of Communism and Socialism. The purest form of each would result in a better life for people with childhoods similar to Guevara.</p>

					<p>Dr. Black said this was a free write, was I the only one to hear that?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if anyone keeps up with the conflict between Russia and Chechnya rebels from the Northern Caucasus Mountains, but as many of you my have heard this week, there was a dual suicide bombing in Moscow on Monday. I believe it was the largest suicide bomber attack on the Russian capital yet by the separatist and has reawakened dormant fears of a little war that clearly has long arms. I&#8217;ve always been interested in the reasons conflict grows and goes so far as to cause individuals to be caught up into a movement so violent that they would kill crowds on subways, buses and trains by detonating an explosive on their person, and with all the speculation and fear mongering I rarely here &#8220;experts&#8221; talk about the mindset and psychology of suicide bombers and the reasons they kill themselves, other than the simple answer of jihad. Most people who utter the phrase jihad know very little about the historical importance of this type of movement and application of force. These Mujihadeen fighters are not well-funded Al-Qeada mercenaries, these are holy warriors in the truest since of the term, and for them it is honorable to sacrifice oneself in battle. The Japanese Bushido Code would be a good comparison.</p>
<p>The war in Chechnya has been raging for almost two decades with over 100000 people dead and countless other casualties. To see how someone from a family that has been fighting for territory and survival would be willing to sacrifice themselves for a cause they see as just is very forth telling about the mindset present in the individuals. I&#8217;ve read some literature on the subject and from what I&#8217;ve gathered the sacrificial nature of suicide attacks and the mindset of the attackers has become that of necessity instead of religious furfer. If there is no peace for us, there will be no peace for them mentality. For almost a generation Chechnya youth have lived and grown up in a climate of rage against the Russians. This has sowed deep rifts in the way fighters on both sides view the conflict and how human life can become so cheap. Many of these suicide bombings are in retaliation against Russian imperialist aggression in the Northern Caucasus.</p>

					<p>The Great Fire burned for 49 hours, destroyed nearly 280,000 homes, and claimed the lives of over 40,000 people while destroying 2/3 of the city of Istanbul.  Thousands more died from the plague that followed the fire.  Churches were originally allowed to remain standing, because Islamic law forbids them to tear down existing structures. But things changed when the Ottomans saw an opportunity to use space to enhance their goals of reasserting their dominance through spatial power.  The Jews were in the way when the Ottomans wanted to expand and build a mosque, so they crammed the Jews into a smaller space and said it was a “space where they could exist peacefully.  The Ottomans were running low on money, had poor leadership because the ruler was too young to rule so his mother had to rule in place of him.  The building of the mosque signaled power and prestige by using the power of symbolism.  The Ottomans ended up tearing down numerous Christian churches.  The Jews lost the powerful positions in the castle and Arabic sayings were place on seemingly everything throughout the kingdom.</p>
<p>Kohler Village also used spatial relations to assert an image by creating the, “garden at the factory gate.”  The factory was the place of the man and the home was the place of the woman.  Kohler Village used the homes of the workers to show that their workers use and love the appliances made by Kohler, you should too.  The city was designed where nice two storey homes that the foreman lived in would be right next to basically a shack that a factory worker lived in to try and hide the class distinction.  Strikes in the 30’s were useless by the workers and they lost, but in the 50’s the workers gained more ground and accomplished more of their goals although it was not a total victory.  It was interesting to read about the kids of the non striker’s bullied the kids of the strikers.  Kohler Village was an example of spatial relations used to hide class levels.</p>

					<p>Given the open-ended-ness of the prompt this week, I decided to veer away from writing about Histories of the Local (especially considering that I probably already talked more in class than you really wanted to know) and focus instead on that other part of class: you know, finding potential sources for a thesis we&#8217;re (supposedly) getting closer to narrowing down, and reading about the process of research and how to become good, research-oriented historians who fetishize the archive.</p>
<p>And actually, that &#8216;background&#8217; reading is probably the most helpful part of the class so far in some ways. I think Presnell&#8217;s <em>The Information-Literate Historian</em> is full of some really useful knowledge, and it&#8217;s helping me to calm down a little bit when I&#8217;m seized by total paralysis at the prospect of writing a thesis that is, as Presnell puts it way back on page 8, &#8220;a viable topic that not only interests you but also adds to the historical literature.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be frank, while I actually enjoy writing in small doses and don&#8217;t even tend to balk at research papers, my work is at best a polishes sort of synthesis, a good overview of a selected topic (that my unoriginal brain prefers to be suggested by the professor, frequently) and I have no idea how to write something that &#8220;adds to the historical literature.&#8221; Thinking thoughts that haven&#8217;t already been documented? Writing about a group or idea or culture that I don&#8217;t have a lot of previous exposure to? Terrifying. Maybe that&#8217;s why I tend to gravitate towards a quote-unquote &#8220;history of the oppressed,&#8221; and even focus mostly on the twentieth century &#8211; the odds are greater of finding something to work with that hasn&#8217;t already been done to death.</p>
<p>As it is, I still don&#8217;t exactly have a viable topic, although the assignments for the class are giving me a good idea of what does not interest me as a historian. But I think part of my inability to commit to a specific time and place is a fear of not finding primary sources. Do people really release journals and documents to the hands of undergraduates with no publication record and nothing to recommend them but an ID identifying them as a UT student? Would the UT libraries have anything that would prove remotely interesting to me as I commit to a year-long writing process? Would writing about local Knoxville history limit my grad school prospects to schools in the south?</p>
<p>This is why I don&#8217;t do as well with topic-less posts.</p>
<p>To try to add some semblance of substance to the post, I really did love the pieces we read for the &#8220;history of the local&#8221; group. It was exactly the sort of detailed-but-with-broader-social-implications history I love to read. And while the &#8216;background&#8217; readings may have been the most useful to me so far (primary source fears notwithstanding), these local histories were definitely the most engaging. And maybe that is a sign about the sort of research I should be doing.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m not the only one who still doesn&#8217;t exactly have a thesis topic, am I?)</p>

					<p>In most ways &#8220;From Text to Image: Philosophy and the Television Book Show in France, 1953-1968&#8243; resembles the other articles we have dissected for structure and assumptions. In a single technique it stands apart. Tamara Chaplin Matheson bolsters her article with images of her subject. Without them, the piece would have lost much of its appeal.</p>
<p>Six screenshots accompany a brief description of Lectures pour tous in the essay&#8217;s first significant section. Matheson merely says that a &#8220;gradual tightening of the frame mirrored the interview process, which sought through successive questions to seize the intimate truth of the protagonist&#8221; (637). She leaves the rest to the pictures. The first photograph illustrates the show&#8217;s crude look more clearly than any description would have. It is the title shot of the show: &#8220;LECTURES POUR TOUS&#8221; on a sheet of paper over a discarded cartoon frame. Without it, I would have imagined a polished, modern title frame. Instead, the photo took me back into the years of low-budget production. The host of the show, Pierre Desgraupes, fills the entirety of another screenshot, putting a face to a name while breathing life into otherwise arid descriptions. Through a medium-range shot of Pierre Dumayet, Matheson shows the reader the set&#8217;s sparsity, the era&#8217;s fashion, and the show&#8217;s feel. The photographs are black and white, another reminder of the chasm between their age of television and our own. The images are thus a strong ally to the reader&#8217;s imagination.</p>
<p>In other cases they directly support the principle thread of a section&#8217;s argument. One section, &#8220;Gaston Bachelard: Philosophical Signifier&#8221;, argues that the program used the old, bearded, white-haired man to encourage their audience&#8217;s interest in philosophy. He seemed to embody wisdom. The accompanying stills argue in ways words could not. They show how the camera hugged him close, a tangle of hair framing his &#8220;mischievous eyes&#8221; at the center of the screen (646). Since her argument relies upon how the audience would have received this image of philosophy personified, she appeals, successfully, to our own reaction to Bachelard&#8217;s image to reinforce her interpretation of the producers&#8217; intentions. Similarly, the section &#8220;Michel Foucault: Philosophy as Act&#8221; includes nine pictures of him gesturing emphatically. Foucault sits with his hands pressed together, as if concentrating intensely. In another he spreads the fingers on a wild hand and bares his teeth. Matheson does not simply tell us that good philosophy and argumentation can happen on television. She does not just quote interviewer Dumayet saying that &#8220;Foucault is an excellent example&#8221; of how television can &#8220;give demonstrations of this [philosophical] way of thinking&#8221; (655). She lets us see how it looked.</p>
<p>Matheson discusses intellectuals fears that television&#8217;s visual appeals to emotion distract the viewer from reasoned content, thereby detracting from a philosopher&#8217;s serious thought. The article&#8217;s form demonstrates her argument against that point of view. She maintains that television&#8217;s form does not necessarily negate intellect. The image can strengthen the ideas if used correctly. Her article employs the visual in just this way.</p>

					<p>For the section of histories of labor, we had two different articles whose subjects forced the authors to use different methods to reach intriguing conclusions.  First, <em>The Labor Market of the Early Roman Empire</em> argued that the ancient Roman economy was an example of an Gesellschaft, or capitalistic, economy rather than Gemeinschaft, or closed, economy.  His main claim is that historians have mistakenly believed that Rome had a closed labor market because slavery was prevalent in the empire.  This is often seen as a characteristic of Gemeinschaft economies because slaves are normally unable to be a participating member in the labor market.  However, these historians have failed to consider that Roman slavery was unique from the slavery of the European colonial area.  While most colonial systems kept slaves from entering the labor market and had infrequent manumission, the Roman system allowed slaves open access to the labor market and was characterized by frequent manumission.  This meant that slaves were able to work their way out of slavery and enter into partnerships with their former masters.  This subject material clearly forced the author to change his methodology.  While his explanation of why Rome had a Gesellschaft economy is a multi-factor explanation, his article mostly focuses on one single explanation of the labor market: slavery.  Peter Temin is forced to do this because slavery has been mischaracterized by most classical historians in light of more modern forms of slavery.  Also, since most classical sources do not talk about economic matters, Temin uses several modern sources, creating an etic history.  Finally, his reliance on slavery as an important factor makes his article deterministic, since slaves were often freed based on their skills and ability to make money.</p>
<p>The second article, <em>Rural Work, Household Subsistence</em>, by Frank Tobias Higbie, discusses hobos in the early 20th century and how they often worked in order to keep their families alive and afford their homes.  His portrayal is in sharp contrast to many stereotypes that depict migrant workers as homeless and wandering.  Since there are few statistical studies, the subject causes Higbie to look into more qualitative sources, even though he does utilize quanitative sources like almost all economic historians.  In contrast to the Roman article, Higbie approaches his subject from an emic point of view because he is able to see many eyewitness accounts of life as a hobo from various government files and two autobiographies.  Both articles give complex explanations for their phenomena, but <em>Rural Work</em> does not focus on a single factor like the previous article.  Rather, it notes how previous research should be paired with data about home ownership among hobos to create a new picture of the life of a hobo.</p>
<p>Overall, these two articles share many characteristics with most economic histories: wide use of quantitative data, materialist outlook, and the role of social forces over single characters.  However, their different subjects create some variance in their methods and assumptions.  The article about slavery is forced to look at a single factor in great detail in order to overcome a common belief, whereas the hobo article is freer to examine all causes in greater detail.  The Roman article is etic because it relies on modern sources, whereas the hobo article is able to use more primary sources and give an emic feel to the whole article.  Finally, the Roman article focuses on consensus because the slaves worked with the masters in order to secure their freedom and post-freedom livelihood, whereas the hobo article looks at the conflict side of economic history with the connections and tricks used to gain employment in a fiercely competitve market.</p>

					<p>Due to my interest in very local and regional histories, I chose to pick the history of the local for the group reading project last week. One of the works we read was Sundiata Keita Cha-Jua&#8217;s &#8221; &#8216;A Warlike Demonstration&#8217;: Legalism, Violent Self-help, and Electoral Politics in Decatur, Illinois, 1894-1898.&#8221; In it Cha-Jua focuses on a racist lynching in the small town of Decatur and the subsequent reaction taken by the town&#8217;s Black community against further lynchings and racism.<br />      While Cha-Jua does use local newspapers as sources, she also uses oral history and songs as a way of describing hidden histories and &#8220;infrapolitics&#8221; of the community that can be deferred. I thought this was an important technique in telling a community&#8217;s story which through conventional means could not be told. She also very much emphasizes community and identity as playing a large role for both local blacks and whites in relation to their involvement (or lack of there of) in the events described in the work. For instance, the whites in town did not participate in the first lynching because neither the black man that was lynched or his accuser was from the community. The black community became more aggressive in its defense of a possibly 2nd lynching victim a year later because he was from their community and a son of a prominent local woman.<br />   Though such methods and theories of &#8220;infrapolitics&#8221; and local identity can be of great use, it should be noted that they could be false or change over time. The values of the narrator might reflect the community and its understanding of the said event but from the perspective of that later time period. On a side note, I actually looked at the platforms of the two student government parties and was amazed how crappy the incumbents&#8217; platform was. I remember simply voting for people in the past cause I knew them or because a certain party, I think always the incumbents, would get me drunk. I think there should be a AA or &#8220;Apathetic Anarchists&#8221; for Student Government next year.

					<p>Frank Higbie&#8217;s essay &#8220;Rural Work, Household Subsistence, and the North American Working Class: A view from the Midwest<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8221; </span>is a close up look at the life, families, and culture of the American hobo. Higbie uses numerous accounts by actual hobo workers and government databases to support his work while discussing the lives, their place in the labor market, their relation to the communities they temporarily inhabit while working at their seasonal jobs, as well as their making their own class and their gender and sexual preferences. the hobos were not a part of society that are really welcomed with open arms. the general stereotype of the hobo is that of the train riding, bean eating, dirty drifter. Higbie however shows that these men were not mere wanders but like modern nomads going where the work was. whether it was logging, mining, crop harvesting, or some other type of short-term work the hobo was a man not rebelling against society but rather doing what he could to survive in the society he lived in. though the hobo class was made up of down on their luck farmer owners/workers as well similarly placed industrial workers, but among the hobos were many criminals, disabled men, and manageable drunks. though not all hobos were crooks or drunks, that is the stereotype which stuck to the term hobo most strikingly. the discussions on how society and economy effects the contraction of slave labor in Rome and Hobo labor in America even the illegal hiring of Mexicans and immigrant labor today is an interesting look at the effects of economy on hiring practices, for Rome free labor declines in favor of slave labor because the economy was falling and slaves do not get paid, whereas free laborers and such cost more. modern employers hire immigrant illegal employees in order to reduce their costs due to the fact they can pay them under the table for much less than they would regular employees. thus is the cycle of work in the economies of the world.

					<p>I was in the group reading the articles devoted to space. I found the Kohler, Wisconsin article interesting (especially as it is within my area of study) but I didn&#8217;t find the exploration of the idea of space very convincing.</p>
<p>In the Kohler article, there were two basic ways in which the category of space is employed: first, as a means of exploring the geography of the city itself and the contested conceptual mappings of that geography by labor organizers and company spokespeople, and second, in terms of spacial solidarities constructed between worker-residents of Kohler and, depending on whether you ask the union or the company, respectively, workers in other areas and consumers of Kohler products. The first of these is somewhat trivial, the second not convincing. I agree with the author that homes are gendered female and workplaces male, and that this plays out in both company and union literature, but I don&#8217;t think this insight is particularly new or profound. This should be obvious to anyone with a basic familiarity with contemporary feminism. The author does attempt to go beyond this basic insight in her exploration of the business district of the town, but her reading of that district and its gender politics seemed very forced and relied on only a snapshot of the evidence&#8211;there was nearly zero discussion of what women actually did in that area in terms of shopping or what they did in the American Club on the days it was open to them. Of course the area will appear gendered male if you ignore all the roles that women play in it. The idea of this area as a contested terrain was insufficiently explored.</p>
<p>As for solidarities, real or imagined, with workers and consumers, I think it&#8217;s a bit of a stretch to explore this in terms of space. Obviously the category of space applies in the limited sense that these solidarities are felt with other people who are spatially separated, but beyond that trivial fact I don&#8217;t see the application, and the author doesn&#8217;t explain it. In her defense, she only indirectly claims to be exploring this relationship in terms of space, and my criticism would probably be different if I hadn&#8217;t been assigned to read these articles through the lens of the category of space&#8211;something the author didn&#8217;t necessarily intend to happen.</p>
<p>In the other article, the discussion of the way a change in urban geography was used to their own advantage by the powers that were is very interesting, but the category of space is not really theorized. Obviously space played a major role in the changes that occured after the fire, and one can productively think about the ingenious way that spatial changes were used to consolidate power without necessarily challenging the economic or diplomatic power of the targeted populations (which would likely have seemed much more obvious as a source of power). Unfortunately, despite the obvious relevance of the topics explored, there is little to no theorization or discussion of power and its relationship to geographical space.

					<p>This past week I read and analyzed the two articles about work.  I chose work because, being a business student, you do hear about the theories in economics and BA classes.  Reading the first article about the labor market, I wasn&#8217;t surprised at all when it delved into the economic aspects of wages and the flow of work.  However I did find interesting the talk of Roman slavery because I had assumed it worked roughly the same way as colonial slavery.  When you hear about slavery in the past, it&#8217;s no surprise you think of it as American slavery.  But I found it quite interesting that the Roman system wasn&#8217;t like it at all.  It was an open system with frequent manumissions.  That is why the author could make a strong case for the Romans having sort of a pre-industrial labor market.  The fact that slaves could move up and use their skills to improve their jobs emphasizes that point well.  The second article uses a completely different method when looking at work, one that is quite different for a business student.  It uses a sociological method because it is talking about worker experiences and the different kinds of migratory labot, not really the economics of it all.  I actually found this article, overall, the more interesting of the two because it is a sociological viewpoint.  Learning about worker reasoning for being migratory labor and just what conditions were like can tell more about what &#8216;work&#8217; is really like (how it&#8217;s like in practice) than how it is in theory. </p>
<p>I would also like to briefly followup my comments on SGA and the election from last week now that the campaign is over.  Fuse won big, which is the incumbent party and Transform only managed to win 11 Senate seats (with me being one).  Like it always is unfortunately, the Greeks used their connections with freshmen to win.  That&#8217;s all the campaigning Fuse really did.  Transform did everything it could but at least some people got in.  I know the ones who did still plan on doing everything they can to gets students actually involved so it wasn&#8217;t a total defeat.  Other Transform members who didn&#8217;t win also plan to do the same thing, though outside of SGA which could very well be a better thing.</p>
