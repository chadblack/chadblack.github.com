					<p>Well, it looks as if I will play the role of trail blazer and be the first to post. I am under the impression we have an open post to blog about what we would like. I suppose I will dabble in quite a few several topics.</p>
<p>Firstly, in Cha-Jua&#8217;s article, she mentions the usage of Infrapolitics. By definition, it is transcripts hidden in the form of songs or folklore. Cha-Jua describes it as a good way to voice one&#8217;s resentment and thus, it is a weapon of the weak. While many times we read about this folklore, I never have heard it described as Infrapolitics. In regards to the history of slavery and disenfranchised people, Infrapolitics plays an extremely important role. The African-American community of Macon County, Illinois is a prime example. I infer that when Cha-Jua describes it as a weapon of the weak, she is directly referring to disenfranchised people. In regards to Infrapolitics being a decent source, I am doubtful. I would assume people know that over time, stories change depending on who is narrating. Similar to rumors being spread throughout a community. In essence, I believe Infrapolitics provides an interesting alternative perspective, but I would be skeptical of most any Infrapolitics I would be studying. Moreover concerning Cha-Jua, she also stated a fact that caught me off guard. She noted that lynching was ignored for nearly a century. I really cannot grapple my mind around why such a compelling topic would be avoided for so long. While it is a sensitive area, one would think that people would want to learn more about why people would be compelled to lynch a person. Clearly, racism played a center role. But why lynching? What happened to tar-and-feathering? Yet people felt it unnecessary to dive in this topic for several years.</p>
<p>I picked Histories of the &#8220;Local&#8221; because I believe local histories are much more compelling than much anything else. Local histories shape communities, people, and environments for long after the initial action has taken place. These histories can be sacred to the specific community. And these reasons are why I am naturally attracted to these  specific local histories.</p>

					<p>(Another late post, apologies to all.)</p>
<p>As other students pointed out, &#8220;Not All The Orphans Really Are&#8221; was difficult to lump into many of the categories presented in &#8220;The Emperor&#8217;s Mirror,&#8221; which I think is a very positive thing because, as we discussed briefly in class, most of the best history will fall between the various extremes in order to be more effective.</p>
<p>That being said, I would definitely classify &#8220;Not All The Orphans Really Are&#8221; as a more synchronic history, as little change is presented and it analyzes the era as a cohesive whole, in fact as more of a moment in time than a period spanning well over a century.</p>
<p>I would also say that it is more etic, given both the distance from the history considered and the author&#8217;s (presumed) lack of personal experience with eighteenth-century Seville orphanages. This is a more difficult distinction to make, because as Alex and others mentioned, there was much attention paid to the contemporary culture and attitudes, but I still find that it comes from the perspective of an observer, and as a more cultural history I think the style is only appropriate.</p>
<p>Again, the argument is not made that all &#8220;orphans&#8221; can be generalized into one category (indeed, the opposite would seem to be the point) but I still think the piece falls under the nomothethic approach, as it considers many different cases to form its argument. Similarly, I think social forces are more at play in the article (again, appropriate given its nature as a social and cultural history.)</p>
<p>The piece is definitely multi-factor rather than single-factor and qualitative rather than quantitative, as it relies on numerous individual accounts to create a broader picture, and each account would appear to be at least somewhat unique, which is to a large extent the point Tikoff is attempting to make. The qualitative versus quantitative debate was one of the more interesting ones touched on in class to me, as I am (as you could probably all guess) not someone who finds purely quantitative research particularly interesting. That being said, I really do appreciate the use of well-chosen statistics to better express the scale of trends described, and Tikoff&#8217;s figure of 20-40% of children born in Seville between 1800 and 1830 being abandoned to foundling homes is a shocking one. It&#8217;s a good example of why the quantitative/qualitative dichotomy is one especially that should not be pushed to the polarities, and rationale that good history should be a mix. (In fact, I would have liked to see a few more well-chosen numbers thrown into the article.)</p>
<p>Regarding this week&#8217;s side debate into student apathy, most of my thoughts can be found on Alex&#8217;s initial post, although I&#8217;m sure I could talk more about it if gven the slightest provocation.</p>
<p>Also, here is a link to the article I mentioned in class on The Balkanization Of North America, for those interested &#8211; it&#8217;s a really funny read with some interesting points. http://english.pravda.ru/opinion/columnists/109452-0/</p>

					<p>It is clear that Tikoff used many of the themes used in historiography to identify and describe his points in the piece he wrote, “Not All the Orphans Really Are,” that we learned of from “The Emperor’s Mirror.”  Tikoff used a synchronic time period in which he studied the “Long Eighteenth Century,” by examining the orphanage in Seville.  I was a little torn between etic or emic, but I believe the piece is emic because it takes a look at factors such as if you were rich or had some more important status you received easier access to the orphanage.  With the story centering in Seville it could be seen as particularist, but it compares other orphanages in Seville which makes it nomothetic.  Tikoff examined various records that showed data which used the quantitative approach, but he was careful to include valid points regarding that the records might have left certain things out.  Tikoff looked at records that showed how the orphanages were run and planned, also Tikoff wanted to show the identity of the kids there, such as how and why they were there.  This article mainly focused on social forces for example, some parents even placed their kids in the orphanage because of the orphanage’s money and resources, due to their inability to care for the children according to the reading.  Tikoff also focused on the materialst approach by showing how the school became a training facility for naval cadets, but it  focused on ideationalist ideas too by looking at the culture of the day.  There was an obvious consensus that the orphanage was a great place for your child if you could not provide for the child, but there was also conflict as it became harder to get in unless you were rich or important.  It became a conflict when the orphanage stopped meeting the needs of the truly less fortunate and started to become selective based up bloodlines.  I do not think Tikoff really used a stochastic or a determist approach.</p>

					<p>It&#8217;s great to see comments, and its good that people can voice opinions in a healthy academic environment, I&#8217;d like to thank those who have commented on this weeks discussion and I&#8217;d like to thank Dr. Black for allowing us to have rebuttals.</p>
<p>I was in a bit of a fenzy as I wrote my last post and may have not cover all the dichotomous pairs as I should have &#8230; here I go.</p>
<p>Tikoff presents &#8220;Not All Orphans are Ophans&#8221; as a I come to see it as a etic approach to the study of ophanages due to the idea that these institutions were training grounds for 17th and 18th century elitist occupations. The use of orphanages in this way relies heavily on external criteria (institutional) need for filling these occupations as an empire expands and grows. I forgot to touch on earlier on the &#8220;assumptions&#8221; part of the &#8220;Emperor&#8217;s Mirror&#8221;. As Jed mentioned, the conscious of institutions working together was a major theme throughout Tikoff&#8217;s piece and as I stated prior this idea is well established with the etic and social forces aspects as the driving nature of the orphanages in Seville. The piece on orphanages is  assuredly stochastic because of  the different outcomes in life styles and occupancy of these orphans can not be completely dictated or expected.  The institutionalization of the orphanages and its occupants can not guarantee an outcome of complacency. As I&#8217;ve come to believe it if something is conscientious in nature it must be materialist also because of the driving forces that occupy the roles need to make society move forward, for good or for bad, the materialistic impression that Tikoff&#8217;s piece relies on over and over shows how these institutions were built to be a driving force in themselves for a macro-sector of society in Seville.</p>

					<p>The article we read for the discussion in our previous class argued that there is a dichotomy between the children that were supposed to be housed in orphanages and those that actually ended up in orphanges.  The piece is diachrotic because it examines how the orphanges changed from a place for children who lost one or both parents to an institution that granted admission based on whom the family knew.  It examines this process during the Long Eighteenth Century and shows how the orphanges slowly abandoned the group of children they were supposed to house.  This article appears to be emic because it looks at how certain ideas, such as royalty and legitimacy, affected the chance of children to get into a certain orphanage.  This piece could be characterized as particularist or nomothetic depending on the scope; it is particularist because it only focuses on one city, but it is nomothetic because it looks at several orphanges in that city that had differing policies and standards.  I would argue that it is nomothetic because it tries to link together facts from the various orphanges to make a general argument rather than merely describing the conditions of the orphanage.  The article definitely focuses on social forces, as no one person was in control of the process of picking children.  Rather, it was an interaction between parents, relatives, government officials, church officials, and the orphanage officials.  This piece also looks at several factors to describe why orphans were picked: noble status, legitimacy, and parental and familial intervention.   This piece tries to use quantitative and qualitative data to support its position.  Most of this data is found within records kept by the orphanages.</p>
<p>This piece appears to be focused on ideationalist assumptions.  It does look at spots in the orphanges that are bought by people, but it mostly focuses on ideas and values that help children get picked.  From what I can tell, the piece assumes conflict because the geniune orphans are in conflict with other poor children for spots in the orphanages.  Finally, it uses a stochastic assumption because the same conditions do not always assure that two children are both accepted or rejected into an orphanage.</p>

					<p>If I spoke of this area of East Tennessee  as a social bubble it was pure metaphor for the very lack of involvement that is present in the region and to show how the country as a whole is split.</p>
<p>As for the work you do: bravo, truly.  But I&#8217;ve been to several of these &#8220;core group&#8221; meetings and not heard one thing about the gravest problem facing our nation on a daily basis or an attempt at even approaching the subject: the wars. This is the root of most of the problems facing this county. From budget cuts to lives lost, yet this &#8220;core group&#8221; with all of it&#8217;s progressive (what ever that means) ideals doesn&#8217;t blink an eye when Obama sends 30,000 more troops to the meat grinder. Funny thing I guess they just don&#8217;t care. They start to moan and groan about whatever issue they feel like band-wagoning this week to the next.  I would watch who you assume doesn&#8217;t take action around these parts, I feel as if since you haven&#8217;t seen certain individuals, such as myself, at &#8220;core-group&#8221; rallies you think that they must not care. By the time I was a senior in h.s. I was actively protesting the War in Iraq in Washington, and the School of the America&#8217;s in GA. And since then have been involved in protest at the World Bank &amp; IMF in Washington, ORNL, United Mountain Defense, anti-Klan and Neo-Nazi rallies in Tennessee,North Carolina and Georgia, and Wal-Mart&#8217;s use of land space in Chattanooga (notice certain localities, Appalachia mean&#8217;s the world to me!).</p>
<p>Anyways most of these &#8220;progressive&#8221; types  only concern themselves when they get to college anyway, and they become  so disillusioned by the time they leave or  their so wrapped up in their old boring neo-New-Left tactics that they just give-up. I&#8217;d probably get involved but your tactics are boring and non-confrontational (I&#8217;m not talking about violence) take a note from your Berkley brother and sisters, occupy something, make business stop, whatever you have to do to send a message. Is the &#8220;core-group&#8221; worried that they might get arrested or not receive a letter of recommendation because they were seen staging a sit-in in Dr. Chi&#8217;s office? Get out of the UC and off of Cumberland Ave. and go straight to the admin and tell them why your concerned. Believe me, the man on the street could care less about University budget cuts, but you do, so use your head, a 100 person protest doesn&#8217;t matter but news that 100 students occupied the Chancellors office for 24 hrs on a Monday gets people thinking and once you get people thinking you my have some new support in the way of people actually getting involved.</p>
<p>Oh, its the very notion that anyone is discussing any type of politics in this climate of theft, alienation, and fear that what should be disgusting.</p>
<p>This weeks post&#8230;</p>
<p>The use and application of dichotomous approach types is allowing me to understand the type of research a particular historian is training to map out for the readers. The use of these dichotomies is important in not only examining a piece of historical work, but it also gives insight on what type of research can affect the style and importance  the paper that I&#8217;m trying to write. I write this post admitting the understanding of certain dichotomies is a bit vague for me on certain pairs, but hopefully my current grasp will suffice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all orphans really are&#8221; by Valentina Tikoff is an illustration of the life of children in orphanages during 17th and 18th centuries in Seville, Spain. Tikoff&#8217;s use of Seville, a major embarkation point for Spain&#8217;s imperial conquests , although she covered three centuries, shows a particularist approach to orphanages at the time. I believe if it had been nomothetic she would have covered a broader range of geographical location within the long 18th century. Since particularism encompasses the geographical concern of Tikoff&#8217;s piece time can be deduced as a diachronic interpretation to the forces that drove the orphanages from the early 17th century to the early 19th century. I don&#8217;t believe there was much qualitative research able to be extracted from her use of orphanage records as she presented them, because she was looking to describe the life&#8217;s of orphans within the system. The greatest use of a particular within a diatomic pair would have come for the personal influence vs. social forces. From what I gathered the driving of Spanish societies imperialist and Catholic notions led to many more orphans than we would have seen other wise. Also the use of orphanages as a type of preparatory institution was a major tail-tale sign of how society affected the use of orphanages and the Spanish&#8217;s want to &#8220;blossom&#8221; these young people rather than just integrate back into society showed that social-forces rather than personal influence was a cause behind the effect.</p>

					<p>For class this week, we read  &#8220;The Scope of Ethnohistory&#8221; from &#8220;The Emperor&#8217;s Mirror&#8221; and Valentina Tikoff&#8217;s &#8221; &#8216;Not All the Orphans Really Are&#8221;: The Diversity of Seville&#8217;s Juvenile Charity Wards during the Long 18th Century.&#8221;  Its obvious to see that many of the categories and theories that identify historiography and approaches to history, that are described in &#8220;The Emperor&#8217;s Mirror,&#8221; are used in practice in &#8221; &#8216;Not All the Orphans Really Are&#8217; .&#8221;</p>
<p>To start with, Tikoff clearly focuses on social influences as the driving force in history instead of personal influence. Her essay is focused on &#8220;orphanges&#8221; in &#8220;Long 18th Century&#8221; Seville, Spain. This setting and time period could be seen as either synchronic or diachronic. I would argue that it is synchronic since it is focused on one clearly defined time period in a one geographic location. It is neither particularist or nomothetic because it has a physically narrow setting but Tikoff claims Seville&#8217;s charity institutions can be used to understand the rest of Spain and the Spanish Empire in that subject.</p>
<p>The multiple factors used by Tikoff include not only the experiences of the children and the administrators but the relationships to the wealth of the empire and the purposes of the schools. This factors help to highlight the ideals and vision for the taking care of such children while simultaneously showing how parents often sent their children to such orphanages for a better life or out of economic necessity. This shows that Tikoff uses a balance between ideationalist and materalist motivations for human behavior.</p>
<p>As for whether the driving force for human behavior is either conflict or consensus, I think Tikoff&#8217;s essay is largely consensus since it deals with charity work and helping orphans and children. In the &#8220;dichotomous pair&#8221;of phonemic and phonetic, Tikoff uses an approach of both. As for Tikoff being either a determinst or stochastic, she doesn&#8217;t show any hint of supporting one or the other.

					<p>As the authors of The Emperor&#8217;s Mirror state before dividing approaches into dichotomies, &#8220;a scholar often can choose an intermediate position between two extremes&#8221; (16). This is often the case when categorizing  &#8220;Not All the Orphans Really Are&#8221; by Valentina Tikoff using the categories in the &#8220;Conceptual Building Blocks&#8221; section of The Emperor&#8217;s Mirror.<br />
The article defies easy placement in four approaches. The article investigates the long 18th century in Spain&#8217;s history. Many aspects of Spanish society must have changed in those 150 years. Such a sprawling mass of time seemingly points to categorization as &#8216;diachronic&#8217;.  Yet for the institutions handling children in Seville, it was fundamentally a single period dominated by a single structure which transformed at the beginning and end of the period. In this sense it is synchronic. It paints the picture of a &#8216;single&#8217; time. Similarly, the article fits clearly into neither the particularist nor the nomothetic category. It concentrates on Seville. This is a defining quality of the particularist approach. However, it makes broad claims about Spain which should apply to other cases. This is a defining quality of the nomothetic. The article is further confused in its use of emic and etic terminology. It uses both emic (foundling, orphan, noble) and etic (fragmented, the long 18th century, marginals) terminology to redefine the approach to &#8216;orphans&#8217; (she argues that we should divide the category as they did for better understanding) through etic frameworks. Finally, it emphasizes social forces, such as institutions and categories of thought, rather than personal influences. However, it investigates these through some particular cases of individuals and institutions.<br />
In two other approaches it more clearly works within categories. It is largely qualitative rather than quantitative although she identifies patterns. It is also multi-factor rather than single-factor, taking into account multiple actors, institutions, and social forces.<br />
In its assumptions it again defies the categories provided in The Emperor&#8217;s Mirror. It is to some degree both ideationalist and materialist. For example, the categories &#8216;foundling&#8217; and &#8216;orphan&#8217; are clearly evidence of ideas shaping reality while the actions of parents on behalf of their children&#8217;s welfare suggest a materialist bent. Similarly, both consensus and conflict operate within Seville&#8217;s long 18th century history of children. For example, the relative stability of the institutional system itself is evidence of consensus and cooperation. Yet, these institutions were not used in a way that their founders had intended, revealing conflict. Finally, she is neither a clear determinist nor a clear stochastic. She proposes trends in behavior and general understandings of categories but not unbreakable laws for either.<br />
Thus, these categories provide a way to understand more deeply how the article functions and how it argues. They also show the complexity of Tikoff&#8217;s approach. However, the article reveals the categories&#8217; limits. They are only approaches to analysis, not boxes to check.</p>

					<p>i have read a few of the responses so far and this weeks side discussion on student apathy really hit me. first however the dichotomies the tools of research and presentation are highly important to us as we will have to be using them come next semester. rather than full dichotomies however many of the terms on our list are more blended when put into actual use. for exmple, even the most practised of anthropoligists may find it difficult to be completely unbiased and use full emic research. we are all human and no matter how hard we try our own beliefs will rise on occasion when researching cultures we either do not understand or disagree with. while a case study is highly useful to research it is my belief that particularist study needs to be enhanced by nonathletic study. the wider number of reliable sources and research the more complete a picture you get. i disagree with the idea of single factor causes. in my opinion it is largely multiple factors in many actions and what leads up to said reactions. for example the beginning of The Great War is citied as the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand but in fact the cause lies deeper in both the ensuing troop movements by countries who should have been non-players, the hesitation on Austo-Hungary&#8217;s part to react for justice, as well as the faliure of peace talks. most events had several causes rather than just the one cited in high school history books. we should always dig deeper to find all the causes. as far as ideationalist v. materialist  and conflictual v. consensual our world is largely a mixture of each of these causes depending on circumstance and attitudes which are used to drive the world forward. it is not purely on or the other in most cases, if not all.<br />as far as the apathy of students is concerned, it is has been my experience over the last several years that the SGA election is a joke. few if anyone i know has ever voted because they see no point in it, as nothing will get done by either running party. the students i have talked to rarely even knew the vote had occurred let alone cared much because it has no signifcant, if any, impact on their life at the school. the will continue going to class, continue going to the sports games, or plays they want. and none of this will change based on which student is elected to SGA. i not above of any of my friends either. each election that has passed i have never noticed in change in the university that had any impact on myself or anyone i know. so hail the Coup of the ROTC  maybe they will accomplish something.

					<p>After reading the previous blogs on the course site and given our discussion in class, I&#8217;ll split this post up into two parts.  The first being the required topic, the dichotomies, and the second part being the student apathy here at Tennessee.  So this post will probably be very long. </p>
<p>The first dichotomy is synchronic (single point in time) and diachronic (change over time).  While at first it seems it would be diachronic since it covers over 100 years, the article is really synchronic.  It examines the Seville orphanages during the long century and it really isn&#8217;t examing the changes from the start of the Long Century to its conclusion.  It is just identifying what life was like, how they were viewed, and other things at that point in time.  There is some examinations of changes during the Long Century like the new requirement for documents to prove high birth in 1721 but to view it as a comparison to the earlier part of the Long Century would be to miss the point of the article.  Next is emic (immersion) and etic (external).  This article seems to be emic because it really is a close look inside the culture of Seville.  When reading about the orphanages, we get accounts from former residents, administrators, and others offering their opinions on what life was like and how the orphanges operated.  Third comes particularist (one case) and nomothetic (several cases).  This article seems like the answer is both (since only Seville is studied) but going off of the author&#8217;s stated intentions, this article would have to be nomothetic.  It may only examine Seville&#8217;s orphanages but the author wants to use the data to illustrate the connections between children and their cultural settings in Spain as a whole.  Next is quanitative (measurable) and qualitative (not measurable).  This article is qualitative because numbers and statistics weren&#8217;t really used and the author states that a quanitative analysis wasn&#8217;t used either. The fifth dichotmy is personal influence and social forces.  It is primarily social forces as the article examines how orphanges were viewed and used in Seville and why they became such a vital thing for the citizens.  The next set includes ideationalist and materialist.  Considering it talks about the benefits of the orphanges such as an education and training to become a naval officer as well as the lengths people would go to get children into these orphanges, it would be a more materlist focus.  For conflict and consensus, I do not know which one would fit.  There was conflict between those of lower birth with the orphanage administrators because they wanted high birth children (as requiring documention illustrates) but there was also consensus over how useful and beneficial these orphanges were as many tried to get their children or relatives into them.  Finally the last dichotomy was determinist and stochastic-ist.  I&#8217;ll go with determinist because the social class and status of parents/relatives played the major role in determining selection into an orphanage. </p>
<p>While I had started to type a big thing on student apathy here, I think I will have a much better idea of how bad it is after this week&#8217;s SGA elections and could give a better post then.  Anyway, there&#8217;s one party, starts with &#8216;F&#8217;, that is all incumbent and is fully intent on doing nothing for the students, continuing the SGA tradition.  The other party, starts with &#8216;T&#8217;, actually has people who want to make a difference and fight budget cuts and work to help the students.  I was told how during an SGA meeting last week with the Chancellor, only one bothered to ask about budget cuts (he is in &#8216;T&#8217;).  SGA has never been about serving the students and this year will be the election that could change it because it truly is an election between the incumbents and anti-incumbents.  SGA is needed to facilitate the change in student apathy.  If the SGA actually starts fighting for the students, that would certainly have a beneficial result for students as a whole.  I know as a freshman how disgusted I was at the SGA stabbing the student population in the back over the grading scale change.  Of course it looked much worse to everyone when the SGA executives who did the stabbing got rewarded with the Torchbearer Awards.  Reforming SGA is a necessary step into getting students here to care because it is the students&#8217; voice.  If it is not speaking for the students, it is understandable why papathy would be so common.  I will do my part next year.  I joined to do something for the students because I was doubtful if anyone else would.  As it is now, who actually knows the name of their SGA senators?</p>

					<p>Synchronic/Diachronic: This article is synchronic. The time period covered is over a century, but is presented as a single time period. Little or no qualitative distinction is made between the beginning and end of the period. Certainly the purpose of the article is not to contrast the two.</p>
<p>Emic/Etic: I&#8217;m a little confused about how to categorize the article here, but I would say emic since the purpose of the article is to get at contemporary attitudes of and toward orphan children in contrast to the way most of us today conceptualize &#8220;orphanhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Particularist/Nomothetic: Nomothetic. The article briefly discusses many different examples, and also uses records from the orphanages that apply to all or most cases in a given institution.</p>
<p>Personal Influence/Social Forces: A little of both (there is some discussion of individual nobles using personal influence to achieve their ends) but mostly social forces. The article discusses the way that economic developments in the Spanish colonial system caused the rise (or at least increase) of orphanages in Seville and the way the orphanages fit into a broader social system.</p>
<p>Quantitative/Qualitative: Qualitative. The article doesn&#8217;t make use of statistics or calculations but rather of qualitative discussions of a number of cases to prove a point. It&#8217;s not mathematical but, rather, inferential.</p>
<p>Ideationalist/Materialist: Materialist. Again, the discussion gives more attention to the economic causes and social consequences of orphanages than to ideological forces.</p>
<p>Conflict/Consensus: I&#8217;m not sure how to apply this dichotomy. I need to give it more thought&#8230;maybe I&#8217;ll come back and edit this post later.</p>
<p>Determinist/Stochastic: Maybe a little of both. It&#8217;s determinist in that the social/class position of the individual orphan, as well as the status of their living relatives, is thought to play a major role in the outcome of their application, but also stochastic in that each individual case might be different based on more specific circumstances (family connections, persuasiveness of written letters, etc.) I&#8217;m not sure if this really means it&#8217;s stochastic or if it just means it&#8217;s determinist on different factors.

					<p>I will apologize in advance for the length of this post. I plan to address more than the several groups of categories we examined in class. Along with the categories, we also read three separate readings that I plan to critically examine.</p>
<p>In the previous post, I am sure we can all sense the passion of the addressed issue. We are all in school and we understand the importance of our schooling. With the budget cuts on the horizon, we are all facing limits regarding the choice of classes and probably much more. So then I present the question of what we, as students, should do. I am by no means an expert on the budget issue. I have seen small scaled protests and signs/chalk all around campus. The fact is, I simply do not have time to protest at this point in my life. Whether this is because I classify myself as a democrat, as implied by the earlier post, I highly doubt. But everyday seems to have a full load of school, study, work, and the small remainder is usually for personal time which has been known to become more study time. I understand money is tight. I had a 1,500$ scholarship disappear when the economy dried up. This was depressing among many other things. If you wish to protest and give &#8220;the man&#8221; hell, more power to you and I think it is awesome. But if I wish to study or go to work, please don&#8217;t criticize my political affiliation or my life.</p>
<p>I believe the most entertaining reading was the <em>Rethinking History</em> by Jenkins. The first couple paragraphs automatically reminded me of the first day of class when we were asked to define History. The discussion between truth and fallacy was also very interesting. It was, without a doubt, mind-blowing to think if there is no truth, then there is no falsehood either. Jenkins also revealed quite a bit when discussing that the past and history were not necessarily stitched together. All of these caused me to think about what I wrote on that first day of class. I would never have thought that history and the past were not stitched together.</p>
<p>All of the categories could possibly be used while analyzing the <em>Seville</em> excerpt. I am also a little concerned involving the synchronic and diachronic classifications. I understand synchronic is a study at one specific time whereas diachronic is across time. I feel as if any study, for example, Reagan&#8217;s <em>Abortion</em> book could be classified as both. I would consider the <em>Seville</em> excerpt to be classified as diachronic. The readings over <em>Seville</em> could also be classified as both quantitative and qualitative. Even though I would consider it more so quantitative (the # of orphans, the orphan schools), it also had some &#8220;pleasure-reading&#8221; aspects to it. Reading the <em>Seville</em> excerpt was not pain-staking awful like many quantitative readings could very easily be. The categories continue with examples such as conflict vs. consensus and ideationalist vs. materialist. I find it difficult to classify the <em>Seville</em> excerpt in to these due to the lack of information on the actual categories.</p>

					<p>This post isn&#8217;t on the assigned topic but I wanted to post it anyway. The assigned post will come later.</p>
<p>I was annoyed by our discussion in class today about the lack of a student movement in Tennessee. It&#8217;s absolutely true that there is no such movement despite the desperate need for one, but the reasons that folks (read: all of you in class today) give to explain this are alarming. All of the talk I heard about southerners being ignorant and reactionary and &#8220;living in a bubble&#8221; is not only offensive to me as a proud Appalachian, but is an obvious and shallow attempt to deflect blame. Yes, there are large reactionary elements in our society. There are always reactionary elements. But these elements at most make up a slim majority in this area, and more likely a fairly small minority.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the fault of reactionaries that less than 100 UTK students are willing to come out to a protest on an issue that directly effects them. There are way, way more than 100 UTK students who are aware of the crisis in public education, who recognize that it&#8217;s in their own material interests for these cuts not to happen, and who will verbally claim that they believe the cuts shouldn&#8217;t happen. Shit, there are probably a good 10,000 or more students on this campus who would identify as at least moderately liberal in politics. It&#8217;s THEIR FAULT that they aren&#8217;t doing shit about anything, not the fault of right-wing reactionaries. And as far as I can tell almost everyone in our class falls into this category&#8211;y&#8217;all watch the Daily Show and Colbert Report, maybe you read Huffington Post or Daily Kos or something, and you come to class ready and willing to shit-talk conservatives and religious fundamentalists, but have any of you done a single thing to actually resist this (genuinely terrifying) political offensive from the right?</p>
<p>Some of us have been working our asses off to fight back against the cuts to our schools. We&#8217;ve got up early in the morning to stand outside in the cold for hours on end handing out literature about rallies and trying to initiate conversations; we&#8217;ve repeatedly posted flyers on every conceivable wall, doorway, and bulletin board; we&#8217;ve made numerous personal calls to every single person on union phone lists of around a thousand people; we&#8217;ve got up in front of classes presenting petitions and begging fellow students to make even some minimal commitment to sign something or stand outside for a rally; we&#8217;ve written articles and press releases and arranged interviews with every major media outlet in the city and many smaller ones; some folks have even gone around in the UC dining hall soliciting individuals. And yet for all the countless hours that our core group of around two dozen people have all put into this, the result is a turn out at any given event of maybe two or three people for everyone one of us doing this work.</p>
<p>Why? Why, when folks already preach these politics, and when the issue in question is one that directly effects us by costing us money, cutting classes and professors we badly need to graduate, and generally decreasing the value of our degrees, can less than a third of a percent of our student body forces themselves to put even a few minutes of their time into doing something about it? This astounds me.</p>
<p>Go and vote if you want. If the utterly disastrous first year of Obama&#8217;s administration isn&#8217;t enough to convince you that he is not, never will be, and never intended to be a progressive, go vote for him again and sit around twiddling your thumbs and waiting for the jolly old corporate Democrats to throw you a crumb once every few decades. But even if you&#8217;re deluded into thinking substantial change will come from above without us forcing it, this issue is primarily a state and not federal one, and things in the state legislature are even grimmer. How can you fix a problem by voting when even the most progressive and education-friendly of the candidates can barely make the minimal commitment of trying to raise revenue by closing minor tax loopholes? There&#8217;s zero discussion of raising real revenue by taxing wealthy individuals or corporations, zero discussion of diverting revenue from military and national guard spending, and near zero discussion of forcing cuts to take place at administrative rather than academic levels (or worse, through the elimination of low-wage workers). Some of the most reactionary members of the Tennessee legislature are Democrats (including the majority leader), and their Republican opponents are even worse. There&#8217;s nobody to vote for when all of the candidates are openly opposed to everything progressives stand for. Democrats on the national level aren&#8217;t any better, really, but they at least will tell you they are.</p>
<p>Please, please, just do something. If you&#8217;re worried about academic cuts, about the imminent unemployment of janitorial and clerical workers who already make well below a living wage, about the dramatic increase in tuition likely to come within a few years once the Board of Regents gathers the courage to remove the tuition cap, then get involved and ORGANIZE. Grassroots organizations of concerned people are the only way that real change will come, so go be a part of one and make a difference.</p>
<p>Ugh. Nobody will read this anyway.

					<p>(I got confused after the last class and was under the impression that we didn&#8217;t need to write a blog post because of the assignment due, but I just realized today that said reprieve was only for this past week and not for the week of the 17th when I checked the website and saw that everyone else had posted blogs. Oops. So here is my super late blog post and my apology.)</p>
<p>I really loved Thompson&#8217;s paper on the &#8220;moral economy&#8221; of English crowds. I already liked Thompson for other reasons (I like his theoretical writings on historical materialism and Marxism), but what I liked about this particular piece is that he started by <em>politically</em> problematizing a bit of terminology and building an historical thesis from that starting point. Usually, we think it should be the other way around: historical research is supposed to be all about scholarship and objectivity, and to freely admit that your agenda is political in nature is somewhat taboo. But I think this is exactly the kind of scholarship we need. Research should not be done for the sake of adding a few more entries into our cultural &#8216;knowledge&#8217; database, but rather should serve some social purpose. Obviously not every historian begins their research project with such a purpose in mind, which is fine, but historical writing is that much more enjoyable (for me) to read when such a purpose is central and is clearly stated.</p>
<p>Of course, Thompson does not attack the work of other historians simply on the basis that it&#8217;s upsetting to his politics. He uses as a starting point statements which appear politically problematic, and then explores the research and assumptions behind those statements to see if his intuitions are correct. I think he convincingly argues that they are. But it isn&#8217;t really about uncovering the &#8220;truth&#8221; about history and seeing which political theory said truth best coheres with: all historical writing imposes a political narrative, consciously or not, on the history being told, and in a way Thompson&#8217;s project is just to show that a very different kind of story can be told. Obviously, standards of historical scholarship should be just as important a criteria as politics in judging the story beind told, but I think we should be honest with ourselves and admit that politics are also important and that they will always influence our judgment whether we want them to or not and, hence, that we should clarify the relationship between scholarship and politics so that we can apply political criteria critically and not blindly. Thompson&#8217;s article is a great example of what it looks like to do this. The rest of this process is that the article is valuable both to the professional historian and to the layperson, that it contains both an interesting story and a recognizable political moral. I wish there were more histories like this!

					<p>EP Thompson&#8217;s “The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century” was perhaps the most enlightening read this semester. I have been a student of popular uprisings and social movements for several years now and I had heard about Edward Thompson, but for reasons outside of history. I read his biography on William Blake. But anyways &#8230; &#8220;The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century &#8221; was a great social mapping of the tendencies and objectives of the peasantry during the 1700&#8242;s in England. I was genuinely surprised by the seemingly collected and rationale state the crowd seemed to demonstrate through the system of paternalism. To be honest before I read this article I thought that most hungry mobs of the eighteenth century would have been blood seeking irrationalist, but the way in which EP Thompson presented the idea of the market place being a staging point for mobs showed to me that the organization of common purpose was much move evolved than I had previously assumed. They notion that the crowds would regulate the &#8220;market prices&#8221; of goods showed that the ideas of the Enlightenment had defiantly had some realization at the lower levels in society. Thompson also showed how the emerging capital system was competing and clashing with the older system of mercantilism and paternalism. I have been very interested in this period ever since I took a course on human rights which discussed this idea of economic systems competing for the market space which often culminates in violence. The emergence of the capitalist brand clearly puts strains on economic relationships between producer and consumer, as Thompson pointed out how the old system of paternalism had created security for good being priced at affordable costs, but this emergence of capital gains clearly led to an open-ended competition for the consumers money. Farmers made deals with miller and bakers, that was what the system of paternalism was trying to effectively cut out, but as history show us the stronger system has thrown the other by the wayside. I think it might be high time to meet up in a market place and discuss some ways of changing things up a bit.</p>

					<p>The success of any research depends upon clearly defined goals. Making them clear depends upon an understanding of the historical space in which they operate. The same is true when presenting the results of that research. The audience must have surveyed the previous historical map before they can appreciate the new landscape an argument draws. It is imperative that the writer sketch that map as clearly as possible before erasing bits of it or drawing new features. If their readers have walked the terrain before, they may not need to draw much, just a major landmark here and a sign there. But if the readers are foreigners, they need more detail both for direction and to appreciate the grace of a new vista.<br />
Both E.P. Thompson and K. Gauderman drew maps that placed them, and, thus, their goals, on the map clearly for their colleagues. Thompson outlined his view of how historians had treated Early Modern English &#8216;riots&#8217; and &#8216;mobs&#8217;, saying that they had stopped investigation just as it got interesting. He then showed how his argument would probe more deeply to find which factors determined why the crowd reacted the way it did. In essence, he charged historians to go into more detail and see that public outrage manifests itself differently in various historical circumstances. A broad view would not be sufficient. By contrast, Gauderman sought not to fill in details and reorient focus but to change a picture that historians had drawn based on insufficient information. They had erroneously assumed that conditions in Early Modern Latin America mirrored those of Spain. Not only was this invalid but the picture of a hierarchical, patriarchal Spain, of which Latin America was a supposed rough copy, lacked nuance. By outlining how both of these pictures were wrong, she carves a niche for her own argument for a decentralized legal, cultural and economic Latin America without significant gender restrictions. Thus, both historians gracefully unfurl a map on the table before altering it in our presence.<br />
However, there were moments of confusion as I read each piece. For instance, I did not know the economic landscape of Quito well enough to see that Gauderman&#8217;s argument was as tight as it was. For this, I criticized her on a point that would not have come to mind if I had known that she was addressing all the relevant spheres of economic activity in Quito. Thus, I would have benefited from a more detailed introductory section to her paper than was necessary for her target audience, Latin American specialists.<br />
When writing our own papers in the fall and spring of next year, this question of how to introduce our argument will become more important. That which is not a part of our argument, that which we reject, is actually the first important step to our own argument. It will serve to demonstrate our understanding of what we address, building our credibility, creating the sense of justice by which we bolster or undermine previous work. Yet, this will not be just a matter of which facts need presentation but of the structure in which they are presented. We need to pay attention to which structures were effective. These essays, due to their success and length similar to our own papers, provide good examples to follow.</p>

					<p>Both of the articles we looked at this week were published in journals, but there was a sizable difference between the two.  EP Thompson&#8217;s article was fifty pages long and was split into eight sections.  The extra length given to Thompson allowed him to develop a more complicated thesis; he was able to present what the moral principles of the English crowd were in the eighteenth century and he was able to show the forces that operated against them.  Thompson was also able to use a wide variety of sources, including court cases, poetry, petitions, official correspondence, and publications for the upper classes including <em>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</em>.  Kimberly Gauderman&#8217;s article was limited because it was only fifteen pages long.  Thus, her thesis is much less complicated; it merely states that women were more involved in the colonial economy than previously thought.  Although she does refute the argument that Quito was in economic decline in the seventeenth century, she does not offer much conflicting evidence against her thesis of women&#8217;s involvement in the economy.  Her range of documents is also much smaller; it mostly consists of court records and notarized documents.  However, she might have less of an obligation to show conflicting evidence due to her space constraints.</p>
<p>I thought that Thompson&#8217;s article presented a more complex and compelling thesis, but I feel that Gauderman did a better job of writing.  Thompson&#8217;s aritcle was wordy and overly complex at times and seemed to repeat points in multiple cases, whereas Gauderman did an excellent job of tying her examples together to prove her arguments.  Overall, Gauderman&#8217;s article gave me more insight into the paper I will be writing next year.  I am thinking about doing a microhistorical analysis of the effects of the failure of the nullification movement, and this article gave me a good example of how I could use the narratives of different people and tie them together to make an argument.  Also, I typically try to integrate quotations into the flow of my writing rather than relying on block quotations, and her article offered an excellent example of how to do this.</p>
