					<p>this weeks class was very interesting. looking at the way a journal is constructed is very helpful since the length of the average journal article is more or less the same length as the papers that we will have to prepare for our thesis work in the coming semesters. the journals are very concise and very to the point. unlike numerous high school papers which are largely fluff and &#8220;b.s.&#8221; our papers, much like the journal articles we read this week, must be precise, well structured, convincing and well researched, without fluff. the Quito article focused on a central issue from a large perspective before refining it down smaller and smaller to the case of women in Quito. when first faced with the idea of my own thesis i was very daunted at the idea because my thoughts quickly went to monographs and the sheer length of even the smallest history books seems an impossible task when you are still in college. looking at the articles and how they are structured brings the future assignment into a better perspective. after exmining the journals this week I better understand the task ahead and how i need to approach it. it really helped with the problem of what to study. the way in which Kimberly Gauderman began with the issue and then progressively refined it into a single case was very interesting and appears a useful tool to remember, whether it helps with this thesis or future ones.

					<p>E. P. Thompson looked at riots and how the mob mentality legitimates their claims for rioting by examining several cases.  Thompson starts by showing the how nobles used a paternalistic model and the fear of riots often influenced their decision making.  The mob’s main objections were that items were not being sold at a fair price and they had limited access due to the “backdoor deals.”  The mob wanted the goods to be sold at market price in the market and not from someone’s doorstep.  Thompson dove into the larger issue of the moral economy and looked at the consumers reactions when prices changed.  It was interesting to note that most of the riots were not when food supply was empty and people were hungry, but when the prices went up, the price changes cause the customers to become angry.  The riots were not violent displays of anarchy, the price changes were a common cause the customers collectively were against.  Thompson uses the example of the baker that did not actually set the prices, but the baker had advice from the nobility.  This mob mentality soon faded out as the paternalistic model gave way for capitalism.  In the Quito reading about the Era of Prosperity, the author looked at women in society and a different kind of economy.  Women were often more involved in the textile industry, which was the most profitable activity in the region.  The other regions were reliant on silver production.  Women played an active role in the market, which the author based her claims from old criminal and notary records due to the fact that almost everything was recorded due to the societal demands.  These types of records are very valuable to a historian by aiding in all types of research.  Obviously both essays focus on economic issues that were facing the people of that time, so it is in a way the economic pop culture of that era.  It was refreshing to read an economic piece that did not just tell you economic theories and facts.  Both of these pieces portrayed economic issues in ways that did not just tell the reader this economic theory is correct, but it showed an economic problem mixed with issues that plagued the people in their region.</p>

					<p>This past week we read two journal articles, one by Kimberly Gauderman about the role of women in 17th Century Quito and one by EP Thompson about food riots in 18th Century England.  Both were good examples of what a journal article should be, in how it&#8217;s structured, researched, and the topic.  However, as someone who has just started getting a good understanding of journal articles and historical works in general, I felt that Gauderman&#8217;s article was a better example of what is needed and how it should be done.  First, I think it is necessary to point out that since it is shorter, it does help someone who is new to what we&#8217;ve been doing in class the past few weeks because everything is more compact and it helps transitions and the thesis statement, for example, more visible and easier to pick out.  I think it&#8217;s important to understand how to work with the smaller articles before you move onto the bigger ones.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Gauderman&#8217;s article was very useful in gaining an understanding about how journal articles work.  The first section was the introduction which explained the decentralization of colonial Spanish society and why that was important for her work.  In the second paragraph, she states the thesis and research methods and then proceeds to give the outline of her article which, as we discussed a week and a half ago, are the same things you would find in an introduction to a book.  Essentially a book or journal article have the same format, just differing lengths which is why understanding this article can be so useful in reading other historical works, you know where and what to look for.   Anyway, the book then starts its transition into the main part of the work, moving to a narrower topic each time.  It starts with women&#8217;s economic roles in spanish culture, then the economy of Quito, and then her research into Quito&#8217;s textile industry.  The first two topics provide background and give context on why women could have an economic impact and why studying Quito would be better than perhaps other locations.  After those topics, we know spanish women could succeed because of the colonies&#8217; decentralization and that Quito was a stable, prosperous textile town and not an unstable mineral town.  Now we can move into the crux of the argument by reading the stories of various women in the textile industry, showing that women did have an economic impact in Quito through the textile industry while also detailing other information like the horrible conditions for the indigenous workers.  She then wraps everything up with the conclusion at the end.  Gauderman&#8217;s article did a great job at showing the necessary features of any historical work and her article in particular is a good starting point for anyone learning about research and how to properly read a work of history.  It certainly will help reading longer articles and books.</p>

					<p>For me, this week may be the most difficult to review. We analyzed three different articles that varied drastically. Specifically, my group critically analyzed the Kimberly Gauderman article. While I have read all articles, the article that interests me the most is <em>The Craft of Research.</em> This specific piece of reading interests me due to the fact that I had a difficult time finding a historical monograph for our first paper. In class, we also discussed the aspects of certain journals that publish historical works. This also interested me because I had no real prior knowledge regarding the way these academic journals work.</p>
<p>Gauderman&#8217;s work, <em>A Loom of Her Own,</em> covered multiple facets. While it covered specific Latin history, it also covered an important aspect of woman&#8217;s history. She did an excellent job examining Quito and, in fact, we had a difficult time noticing any material that could be considered a mistake. The structure of this article was exceptionally good as well. She set up a firm foundation and then brought us into her topic. We knew a little about Quito before she began examining the textile production in Quito. Setting up such a foundation helped us non-educated in this particular field understand the topic much better. Quito was also a magnificent story in the tale of the history of women. I understand there are exceptions, but for the most part, women were culturally restrained during this time period. While women were being made care for the children and not much else, Quito was the setting where women could invest with interest in particular fields of the economy. This is unheard of across much of the world at that time. In a sense, the fact that women were so actively involved in the economy is more than many countries can boast today.</p>
<p>Picking a historical monograph for me was not an easy task. <em>The Craft of Research, </em>though dull at times, shed a light on a possible topic. While the step-by-step directions seem elementary, they aided someone who was completely lost without direction. Narrowing your question down is very important. Equally important is forming critical questions. Both of these facts are extremely critical when writing one&#8217;s paper. Often times, when I write a paper I begin to get distracted and I wander. Having a document such as this one minimized in order for reference can keep one focused and keep one from wandering in the middle of the paper. I fully expect to utilize it often times when writing these &#8220;big boy&#8221; papers.</p>

					<p>(terrifically late post, whoops!)</p>
<p>Reading Reagan and Rossinow was interesting as they presented two very different ways of looking at history, at least in the initial chapters we read. Both examined a cultural issue in America through the microcosm of one specifically chosen city, but the sources considered and overall themes and goals of the pieces were quite different.</p>
<p>Personally, I much preferred Reagan&#8217;s piece, for some of the reasons we discussed in class. It was more accessible, I felt, focusing less on philosophy and more on specific instances and recordable fact. Similarly, we found that we preferred Reagan&#8217;s methodology, incomplete as it may have been, specifically as regards racial disparity, as it focused more on primary sources and firsthand accounts than Rossinow&#8217;s research, which involved more intangibles and more secondary works. Reagan also did a better job in the first few chapters of convincing me that Chicago was representative of urban America as a whole. While apparently Rossinow later discussed historical significance of Texan figures in greater detail, it was less immediately engaging.</p>
<p>That being said, it was interesting to be reading some monographs and getting an idea of what we might be looking for as we narrow in on a thesis topic and books to consider for our first assignments.</p>

					<p>The readings for this week, Reagan and Rossinow, were both much different than I had anticipated. I had not expected the randomness of the topics, but once we got into class I understood more the purpose for reading these works. Both took similar approaches to their structure. Both had excellent introductions that set the background for the rest of the book, and both had strong, direct theses. The two readings also were based on case studies. Chicago for Reagan and Austin for Rossinow. I felt that this was a weak point in both works. I understand that Chicago is a solid case study for a book on abortion because it is a big metro area with all kinds of people in it, but I still felt that the book would have been improved had Reagan taken a somewhat different approach. She could have taken a few case studies from different parts of the country, say Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas as larger cities, and maybe a smaller city in the South and a smaller in the North as well. This would have covered a more broad area that could actually be considered a study of the country more than taking one city and claiming it to be a study indicative of the whole country. Rossinow could have done the same, but I feel it would have been more effective for Reagan&#8217;s book. I also wish that Reagan had not based most of her research on coroner and court records. Maybe she could have interviewed some women or doctors from this time period to strengthen her book. As far as reading goes, I enjoyed the Reagan book much more. I had not read much on the topic of abortion and honestly did not know about the hush hush abortions of this time period. But once it had been brought to my attention it made a lot of sense. I also felt that her style of writing was more engaging to the reader. I honestly had a hard time getting through the Rossinow reading. I am just not very interested in the topic and to me his writing seemed all over the place. It was hard for me to keep up with.</p>

					<p>Something I found interesting about the reading selections for this week is that both works had somewhat sweeping theses that were supposed to apply on the national level, and yet the vast majority of the evidence presented in both was drawn from a single location&#8211;Chicago in the Reagan book, University of Texas &#8211; Austin in the Rossinow book.</p>
<p>The jump from a single location to conclusions about the entire nation seems less problematic in the Reagan book. Chicago was a huge and diverse city and while practices surely varied somewhat from city to city, it stretched the bounds of credibility to suggest that Chicago was some crazy anomaly in which abortion was viewed and treated totally differently than in all other places&#8211;and indeed Reagan presents some limited evidence that it was not in the form of letters from people in other cities claiming that things were much the same for them. Granted, what applies to cities likely does not apply to rural areas, but Reagan acknowledges this and doesn&#8217;t claim that her conclusions are fully applicable to those areas.</p>
<p>In the Rossinow book, by contrast, this methodology seems very problematic.  By Rossinow&#8217;s own admission, UT &#8211; Austin was a progressive oasis in the midst of right-wing Texas, and I can see no reason to assume that what holds for that school would hold for the New Left elsewhere. Rossinow convincingly demonstrates that UTA differed greatly from the stereotype of SDS based on the SDS chapters in NYC and Chicago and Berkeley and so on (the &#8216;northern rim&#8217; of the country), and less convincingly demonstrates that a number of other schools had New Left cultures more like Austin than NYC, but he falls well short of fully defending his thesis that this alternative culture was really the dominant one for most members of the New Left. Actually, based on the first two chapters (and a quick flip through of the others), I would say that he has written a fine (if somewhat repetitive) book that defends a somewhat different thesis from the one he claims to defend.  And in fact, after a few initial overstatements of his thesis, he doesn&#8217;t really seem to even be trying to demonstrate anything more than that there was an alternative culture in the New Left that differs from the one we typically think of.</p>
<p>I should note that I had objections to Rossinow&#8217;s thesis from the beginning, as I happen to know quite a few veterans of the original SDS (and other New Left groups like SNCC) who tell a different story from Rossinow&#8211;and not all of them were in big northern cities. The story of the left as I&#8217;ve always heard (and experienced) it is that, at least during the post-World War II era and likely long before, there have always been two radically different cultures existing side by side in a somewhat awkward truce: one grounded in a long and intellectual tradition going back to Marx and the First International and usually oriented toward labor, the other a very counter-cultural, freespirited group who often identify as anarchists. The former tend to be exasperated by the latter, and the latter tend to think the former are outdated and overly academic. Undoubtedly, geographical location is a major factor in the numbers of people by which each of these traditions is represented, but it&#8217;s a mistake (and one that Rossinow seems to make) not to recognize that members of both groups are usually present on any given campus and in any given city, and thus that looking for one single historical narrative to explain &#8220;New Left culture&#8221; is a project bound to fail because there are at least two very different cultures in any given left movement.

					<p>I went out-of-town Friday and nearly forgot about this weeks post. Last week in class we discussed the ways historians approach to authorship by understanding; the object of research, the subject of their thesis, and narrative recount style We looked at several chapters from Doug Rossinow&#8217;s <em>The Politics of Authenticity: Liberalism, Christianity, and the New Left in America</em>n and Leslie J. Reagan&#8217;s <em>When Abortion Was a Crime: Women, Medicine and Law in the United States, 1867-1973</em>.</p>
<p>Reagan&#8217;s book was the highlight read and struck me as a very engaging and dynamic piece of original history. It represented an untold part of American, medical, and legal history that I haven&#8217;t really thought about but assumed was a dark reality of American social secrets. In a way Reagan approved my assumptions by showing how the established governing medical board American Medical Association and the media of the day stamped out any real debate on the matter of performing abortions, but she did allow for realization that the reality of performing abortions was against all physician moral code, nor was it a strictly religious endeavor to deter the efforts of women&#8217;s rights. See went on to show that abortion participants were often persuaded by female associates to have these abortions performed. I must disagree with some of my fellow classmates stance on the use of death certificates as a definitive representation of abortions during this time other than who dead during these times and possibly acquiring a social demographic of the ladies who are deceased. Quantitatively there are only assumptions to the data plucked from the death certificates.</p>
<p>Rossinov wrote about a subject that I am fimialar with, the New Left, but presented, at least in chapter one, a pylosophical origins of the New Left which I must say I had really read about but had been subconsciously aware of due to the roots in black church groups of the mid-1950&#8242;s. I am a huge fan of music of 1960&#8242;s Texas like the 13th Floor Elevators and Josephus so Rossinov&#8217;s book built in my mind a foundational roadmap that would lead to the cultural revolution which occured in the mid-60&#8242;s. The idea he presented was the search for the common spirit, a common manhood,  a common acceptance, to so that the disauliemnt of life in the mid to late 50&#8242;s Texas brought about a hunger for a search for a commonplace which was so vital to the civil rights movement, youth movement, anti-war and dozens of other movements that searched for that common thread. Sadly Rossinov also showed that the commonplace mentality would led to the break-up of the New Left due to gains accquired in rights by 1964, and the split of ideologies that occured during the late-60&#8242;s and early-70&#8242;s.</p>

					<p>In our discussion this week, we critiqued two academic monographs: <em>When Abortion Was a Crime</em> by Leslie J. Reagan and <em>The Politics of Authenticity </em>by Doug Rossinow.  Both of these monographs use microhistorical analysis to provide a new context to their subject choice, and both of them claim to pursue new ground in their respective field.  Reagan&#8217;s book chronicles the entire era in which abortion was illegal in the United States, choosing to focus on the time where it was illegal rather than the time in which it was criminalized or the period where it was legalized.  Rossinow claims that his microhistory of one center of the New Left, Austin, Texas, proves that the New Left movement rose from existing concepts rather than the personality of their leaders alone.  Both texts also provide clear theses on their historical problem.  In <em>When Abortion was a Crime,</em> Reagan posits that the evidence shows a two differing moral views of abortion: one for the public sphere of medicine and law that forbade abortion and another within the private sphere of personal relationships that permitted and sometimes abetted abortions. <em>The Politics of Authenticity</em> posits that the New Left movement rose from a philosophical effort to find authenticity and unity in politics, and that the various ethnic and gender movements broke apart this by claiming that there was more than one method of finding authenticity.</p>
<p>Although these two texts are microhistories, they differ in the techniques used to create that microhistory.  Reagan relies on case files from investigations into women who died from their abortion.  These are useful because they provide a deep story into how a system of friends, lovers, and sympathetic doctors allowed women to retain their reproductive rights in the face of legal and professional pressure.  These case files provide a much deeper picture than mere statistics, but they have some pitfalls as well.  Since they only focus on patients who died, they might miss a true cross-section of women who received abortions.  Perhaps women who could afford more expensive doctors had a lower death rate and thus were not well documented.  However, this appears to be a useful method for finding compelling results, especially considering the difficulty of finding documentation for the history of crimes.</p>
<p>In <em>The Politics of Authenticity</em>, Rossinow finds that using oral history provides better results.  His description of the Christian Faith-and-Life Community, which he asserts is vital in understanding the New Left movement in Austin, relies on interviews given by former members of the Community.  Rossinow succeeds in providing a balanced view of the center, quoting both avid supporters of the community and the New Left movement as well as those who were opposed to the center.  The primary pitfall of this method is that it depends on the memories of those interviewed, and these might have faded after forty to fifty years.  However, Rossinow leans on an extensive amount of outside data about the political situation in Austin and the Christian existentialist movement to prove the statements made by the Community members and provide credence to their stories.</p>
<p>Overall, both of these monographs give us a compelling argument on their theses.  Both were interesting, if occasionally dry, readings, and they certainly used microhistory well to give character to the larger movements described in them.  I saw how microhistory can be a useful tool, but I was reminded that outside evidence is needed to ensure that my writing is not describing an anomaly within a larger movement.</p>

					<p>The Reagan article on abortion was interesting in that it looked at an issue that has been beaten into people&#8217;s minds time and again but from an angle that had not yet been discussed. discussing a period of time in which people have not written about yet. writing on a fresh topic is very important because if people are bored with hearing about a topic you chose then your time is wasted in writing because even if you have fresh ideas it will be difficult to get people to read your writing. Reagan&#8217;s writing however cites mainly coroners and doctors statements. these first hand accounts of these individuals is more trustworthy than doing research based on work other scholars did. though other scholars may provide valuable info as was learned from Historians in Trouble not all historians can be trusted so it is far better to do ones own research focused on primary sources. media has made the abortion issue bigger than it really is. based on Reagan&#8217;s work it seems that the idea of abortion was merely a generally accepted fact and form of birth control. the experiences and statements that Reagan include about the nonchalant attitudes of women in referring each other to the right doctors or &#8216;home remedies&#8217; which will fix the problem or &#8216;sickness&#8217; is striking compared to the outspoken abortionists and oppressed women stereotype. these inclusions make <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Reagan&#8217;s</span> argument more <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">believable</span> then if she had merely cited the work of another authors research rather than her own.

					<p>The clearest difference in method between &#8220;When Abortion Was a Crime&#8221; and &#8220;The Politics of Authenticity&#8221; in the first two chapters of each book is their respective chief sources of information. While Reagan mostly relied on coroners&#8217; reports and newspaper articles, Rossinow seemed to depend more heavily on the works of intellectuals and secondary sources. It came out in discussion that some of us thought this emphasis weakened Rossinow&#8217;s work, undermining his real proximity to the events and his claim that this was a New Left history of the New Left. On the other hand, Reagan&#8217;s sometimes tedious anecdotal presentation of evidence frustrated us. These details sometimes seemed a case of not seeing the forest for the trees. Furthermore, some of us felt like the opposition to abortion was not sufficiently outlined due to an overemphasis on particular stories of women and their experience of abortion. In effect, the criticism was that Rossinow floated too far above the action in the intellectual clouds while Reagan never seemed to reach the clouds to peer down upon the issues as a whole.<br />
These analyses have some legitimacy. Some survey of opinion in different groups of society would have strengthened Reagan&#8217;s work by giving us a solid footing before we stooped to collect all those details. Greater ties to Austin students through anecdotes would have shown more clearly that this was a history of a movement made up of people, not a smoky group of ideas arising from various intellectual fires.<br />
However, their subjects determined their focus and sources to a great extent. Reagan was trying to break with a tradition that focused too heavily on the law as written and the ideas apart from experience. Thus, she needed to wade through experience because others had only skimmed across the surface. Furthermore, the nature of her subject, average people, removes her from some of the lofty discourse Rossinow surveys. She is in the process of constructing a mass of information to step back and synthesize. By contrast, Rossinow aimed to explain an intellectual current. This required much discussion of individuals far removed from the action. For instance, only with a clear exposition of the Christian Existentialist ideas which he claims influenced the New Left would he be able to show how these ideas affected their later work and the entire movement.<br />
Moreover, the complaints seem to have their roots more in presentation and our reading than the works&#8217; content. Reagan actually did a good deal of survey and summary, but it felt lost in the details. It would only be a few sentences here and there, a sort of head above water every few strokes instead of getting out of the pool for a few minutes. The main shortcoming that we experienced as readers and pushed upon her by her subject and goals could have been overcome by a more apparent, divided structure in the first couple chapters. Rossinow wrote more clearly and within more obvious sections than Reagan by virtue of an easier task of summary, but lacked her details that made her work more convincingly a description of reality. However, he did have some of these details at the beginning in his stories of student connections between papers and the president being forced from UT. The next few chapters would further remedy this deficit by focusing on UT students who climb through the leadership of the New Left. Thus, while each of these works could have been slightly improved in our view through some shifts in focus, they are both strong, convincing works.</p>

					<p>This week for reading, we read excerpts from &#8220;When Abortion Was a Crime: Women, Medicine, and Law in the United States&#8221; by Leslie Reagan and &#8220;The Politics of Authenticity: Liberalism, Christianity, and the New Left in America&#8221; by Doug Rossinow. Both historians in their writings tried to write &#8220;history from below&#8221;. Reagan claims to be writing the first study of an era of abortion from 1867 to 1973 through the stories of those who participated and received abortions. Rossinow, on the other hand, points out that only organizational histories and memoirs written by participants which gave an official &#8220;history from above&#8221; perspective for the New Left had been written before.</p>
<p>Each book shed new light onto the topics. For instance, Rossinow showed the significant impact that Christian Existentialist had on the development of the New Left and their search for authenticity.Reagan showed how middle class married Protestant women were often the ones who had abortions and how it was widely practiced.</p>
<p>Both Reagan and Rossinow also chose two specific cities to study their topics ; respectively Chicago  and Austin, Texas. As mentioned in discussion in class, neither settings and their histories in dealing with the said topics should be thought as &#8220;national&#8221; histories. For instance,  most Americans did not live in urban areas like Chicago during the era of illegal abortion and the city itself was/is very diverse in ethnicity and a large metropolis than many American cities.</p>
<p>The New Left in the unique Texan setting of Austin was, according to Rossinow, very much impacted by Christian Existentialism. He wanted a history of the New Left outside of New York City. His findings might explain the history of the New Left in Austin, Texas but I doubt it could do the same for the New Left elsewhere in the US during the 1960s. Austin was very much a Southern AND Western urban environment with a heavy influence of liberal Protestantism, and eccentric local liberalism in a largely other wise far right wing society.</p>
<p>The sources used were different though in their approaches. You got a good sense of the intellectual development of the New Left in Austin with Rossinow through the writings of Christian existentialists (that the Austin New Left looked to) and secondary sources. It seemed all too abstract. We later learned that he showed how many of the New Lefters went on to become active in the religious world and expressed Christian Existentialism as a reason for their activism. Reagan however focused way too much on anecdotal evidence which largely revolved around abortions gone wrong that led to the deaths of the women who had them. I will give credit to them for showing that Christian Existentialism did have a major role in the New Left and that abortion was being widely practiced and that laws against it weren&#8217;t being enforced.

					<p>The two works we read and discussed in class, other than the Presnell book, this past week were on the topic of illegal abortion and the new left.  On the surface those don&#8217;t seem to be very similar in any way but after reading about them, they have several similarities in the method of research and investigation.  Both of the topics contain very large issues and the question that both historians had when starting their research must have been what would be the best way to go about it.  Should they take data and information from all over the country or should they focus on one area as sort of a case study?  Well both took an area as a case study, for Reagan it was Chicago and for Rossinow it was UT-Austin, and it was successful from what we read.  The reasoning for picking a small area to focus the research is that that particular area is representative of the nation as a whole and as Reagan points out, &#8220;though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a case study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large and small.&#8221;  Focusing on a small area to research and investigate enables the historian to get more detailed and specific and instead of skipping over significant local events to focus on national ones, events that could have gone unnoticed are giving a thorough investigation like the Chicago Times investigation or the CFLC at UT-Austin.  However, by focusing on a certain area, you can be at the mercy of the place in terms of what research you will find.  In Reagan&#8217;s case, only death records and personal stories were available to use to illustrate that use of abortion far more common than believed.  Fortunately for her, those sources did work and supported her case but they may not always.  As for Rossinow, it seemed that occasionally, he would start talking about the minutia of the CFLC which, while can help his explanation about the New Left at UT-Austin, makes the reader wonder just how well it could be expanded to a national level or if it really is relevant to even just UT-Austin.  Although it should be noted that some details that may seem trivial and unnecessary could become better explained later in the book, like the debates between Joe Matthews and John Silber on <em>Waiting for Godot, </em>for example.</p>
<p>Another similarity each shares is the usefulness of the introduction.  It is an essential part for any historical work because it is a skeleton of the work, explains the methods of investigation, contains the thesis, and many other things as well.  The skeleton tells the reader what to expect and what to look out for.  Meanwhile the explanation of the methods of research is needed to understand how the research was acquired and why that way was the best way.  Reagan&#8217;s reasoning for choosing Chicago, which was mentioned earlier, was located in the introduction.  And most importantly, the thesis is required in order to know what the historian is trying to show/prove.  Each introduction we read did a very good job at doing all of those things and even though we only read the first two chapters of the book, by reading the introductions, what we read was better put into context and we have at least a general idea of what followed later in the book.</p>

					<p>Both Leslie Reagan and Doug Rossinow have similar approaches when writing about their topics. They both look beyond the initial assumption. This initial assumption is powerful and digging deeper helps one overcome such an obstacle. For Reagan, she dispels multiple assumptions concerning abortion prior to the Roe v. Wade ruling. Rossinow, though in a more ragged fashion, goes beyond the initial assumption one has of liberalism. Both works were interesting and had rather captivating subjects. There are definite parallels between the works in the form of overcoming initial assumptions.</p>
<p>Reagan&#8217;s book was extremely interesting. I have read the book in full and believe it is better when read entirely. Her examination of abortion in Chicago is interesting. If I were told some of here conclusions prior to the book, I could have easily dismissed them as ridiculous. The fact that married women are more likely to seek an abortion is astonishing. After thinking for a minute, it make a lot of sense. The size of an average family in the 19th century is far greater than the average size of today&#8217;s family. The massive size of the family was burden that fell directly on the back of the mother/wife. This pressure had to be overwhelming at times. This can easily be one of the multiple reasons 19th century women sought abortions in such quantity. The astonishing facts continue throughout the entire book. As we discovered, the weakness of the book could be the sources of some of these statistics. Most, if not all, of Reagan&#8217;s statistics derive from the coroner&#8217;s office. Obviously, not many success stories come from the coroner&#8217;s office. This definitely has the ability to slope one&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p>Frankly, I did not find Rossinow&#8217;s work nearly as interesting as Reagan&#8217;s book. I did believe the first part of Rossinow&#8217;s work was much more entertaining than the second. Rossinow&#8217;s findings are just as surprising as Reagan&#8217;s. I am taken aback that a lack of sincerity would drive the younger generation to &#8220;Christian Existentialism&#8221;. I think it&#8217;s safe to assume the majority of people believe the governments has severe issues. Yet, I do not sense this same group of people is flocking to a religious sect. I think it kind of sounds cult-ish. If people are currently being drawn to religion, I am missing it. Rossinow did put liberalism in perspective. He stated that liberalism was not a reaction Marxism, but rather it was a reaction to the social stains. This, in my opinion, was the best part of Rossinow&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Both writers were persuasive if nothing else. I was more sold on Reagan&#8217;s writing due to her style being more interesting. The coroner&#8217;s office being prevalent in her work was a bit disappointing. Yet, I thought it was interesting nonetheless. These works were different in style but both were informative.</p>

					<p>Leslie Reagan took a look at the issue of abortion and used the city of Chicago as her testing site.  Reagan made a strong argument that abortion was more common than originally believed in every day society.  She uses Chicago as local story to tell a national story, much as Doug Rossinow used the University of Texas at Austin as the setting to tell the national story of the New Left Movement.  Reagan’s arguments are based upon court records, newspaper articles, and coroner reports, while Rossinow’s arguments are based more on secondary sources.  Reagan illustrates the differences in the classes pertaining to birth control through abortion.  It is often overlooked according to her that the middle and upper class women also participated in abortion.  Gender played a role, in that traditionally the woman and her relatives or friends were responsible for finding the doctor or medical supplies to carry out the abortion and the man’s role was to provide the monetary funds for the abortion to be carried out.  The woman&#8217;s friends or relatives often took care of the daily household chores until the mother who aborted her child was healthy enough.  There was also a seemingly subtle battle of the doctors versus the midwives as theme throughout the book, that was interesting to follow.  I think if she would have compared Chicago to other cities it would have held more significance.  I was surprised to learn how abortion was such a common term that was thrown around, I gathered from the reading that people loosely used terms often minimizing the whole situation such as “going to get fixed or straightened out.”  I detected a subtle reference that Reagan believed the media made the issue of abortion worse than it should have been.  Rossinow takes on a similar approach in his narrative by telling a different side of the 1960’s compared to the space race, cold war tension, hippie free love days that we were taught in school.   The youth of the new generation felt alienated by the insincerity or lack of authenticity and turned to religion, in what he calls “Christian Existentialism.” Rossinow said, “Americans-left, right, and middle- now look for authenticity , for reconnection to the divine  and to communities that seem ancient and organic (pg.340).  These religious ideas were formed primarily from the German theologians who formed their ideas based on the aftermath of World War II.  They also turn to politics as a way to get there voice heard due to the alienation they experienced.  In this case, I feel that Rossinow similarly to Reagan should have used more than just one example.  Although, I can understand his point of using a typically conservative area to illustrate how desperate these youth were to look further Left than their normal views.  Rossinow’s case is based more on secondary sources and at times his arguments were a little confusing in comparison to Reagan.  I do not completely agree with the views held by either author, but Reagan&#8217;s book was far more interesting to read.  She offered points of view that I failed to consider and did not seem to force them on the reader like Rossinow did.</p>

					<p>Weiner&#8217;s book <em>Historians in Trouble</em> was an interesting read because it showed how mistakes in writing can be taken very seriously or not seem to have any affect on a person&#8217;s career. The two that appalled me the most were the cases made against Elizabeth Fox-Genovese and Allen Weinstein. I cannot believe that Fox-Genovese got away with the types of harassment she put graduate students through. The fact that she made them do ridiculous and menial tasks for her just so that she would sign their dissertation is utterly insane. And what&#8217;s even worse is the fact that she essentially went unpunished for her transgressions. This case just goes to show how a person in power can so easily abuse that power. The case against Weinstein might be worse in regards to the field of Historiography. How can a writer be given such acclaim for a book that they cannot even back up with verifiable sources. He is unwilling to deposit his sources, like most writers do, into a library or an archive. He claimed he would do this, but never followed through. This should be a major red flag as to the validity of his work, yet there seems to be very little questioning of it. I can simply not fathom why that is the case. He should have been severely reprimanded if he was unwilling to put forth his sources, especially since various people who interviewed claimed that they were misquoted in the book. It is very difficult to grasp the fact that neither one of these respected historians could not have been punished for such faults. If it had been a young writer or a graduate student who had committed such acts then they would almost assuredly have been banned from doing further work in the field of historiography. Just because these individuals have gained prestige gives them no reason to act in the way that they did.</p>

					<p>Before commenting on the &#8220;Statement on Standards&#8221; as per instructions, I quickly want to note a way in which <span style="font-style: italic;">Historians in Trouble</span> ties into a theme from the previous week/text, namely the construction of reality by language. It occurred to me during our class discussion about the way that certain of the accused in the book&#8211;namely Fox-Genovese and Thernstrom&#8211;spun their cases as examples of standing up to the left, as opposed to serious violations of ethical and professional standards, that this is a great example of a change in language totally changing the &#8216;reality&#8217; of the past. And that&#8217;s all I really wanted to say about that.</p>
<p>As for the &#8220;Statement on Standards,&#8221; I didn&#8217;t find the text particularly interesting. Meaning, it reads exactly as you would expect it to read and doesn&#8217;t say anything we don&#8217;t all already know. Sure, you can use it to indict many of the accused in the Wiener book: for example, Weinstein clearly acted in violation of the standard that &#8220;historians favor free, open, equal, and nondiscriminatory access to archival&#8230;collections wherever possible,&#8221; and the Statement&#8217;s claim that &#8220;the plagiarist&#8217;s standard defense&#8211;that he or she was misled by hastily taken and imperfect notes&#8211;is plausible only in the context of a wider tolerance of shoddy work&#8221; is applicable to several of Wiener&#8217;s case studies. But we didn&#8217;t need the Statement to tell us these things.  The real question is, what is the function of the Statement?  Given that it&#8217;s basically a formalized version of fundamental principles all historians are already aware of, what do we gain by approving this formal document?</p>
<p>The obvious answer would be that a governing body can refer to the statement when judging cases of supposed fraud or plagiarism (or whatever), but as there is no longer a body empowered to take action against violations of the standards, this function is questionable.  It&#8217;s also doubtful that anyone really expects university administrators who actually <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> have this power to make reference to the document. It seems to me like the Statement really just exists to make us all feel better about ourselves and our profession.</p>
<p>That said, there is one claim in the document that I found interesting: &#8220;the real penalty for plagiarism is the abhorrence of the community of scholars.&#8221; Is this an accurate description of reality? Do the folks who&#8217;ve got away with plagiarism or fraud really suffer from a permanently damaged reputation within the field? This isn&#8217;t a rhetorical question, as I&#8217;m genuinely curious about the fates of some of the individuals whose faults are described in the book.  What do Pearson&#8217;s colleagues at Franklin and Marshall think of him?  Has his relationship with the rest of his department suffered?  What about that asshole Feldman who tried to prevent David Abraham from getting a job&#8211;does he suffer from working in a community of historians who all think he&#8217;s a shithead, or is life basically the same for him as it always was?

					<p>Our discussion on <em>Historians in Trouble</em> by Jon Wiener provided many interesting insights into the profession of history.  The first and most important insight I found was that attacks on powerful structures, especially structures that make money, are far more damaging on a career than attacks on the &#8220;Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct&#8221; published by the American Historical Association.  All of the authors who were fired or pushed out of history were notable for publishing attacks against institutions that made money.  Michael Bellesies, who resigned from Emory, was attacked by the pro-gun lobby, a lobby that protects a large civilian gun market in the United States.  Although David Abraham did not attack any companies directly, he implicated big businesses in the fall of the Weimar Republic and the rise of the Nazis.  Finally, Mike Davis was attacked by a blogger for having the temerity to show the underside of Los Angeles and threaten the developers and land owners who profit from selling the image of glamor and fame that Los Angeles is famous for.</p>
<p>Jon Wiener titled the section profiling these authors &#8220;Targeted by the Right,&#8221; but I am unsure whether political ideology is the binding force in these cases.  While it is true that conservative groups targeted Bellesies and that two conservative historians targeted Abraham, that does not mean that the Right targeted certain left-wing historians.  For example, Mike Davis appears to have fallen victim to an attack by an angry developer who happened to be conservative.  I believe that the only case that can be attributed with certainty to politics is the Bellesies case; the Abraham case points to the problems of jealousy within the academic world and the Davis case shows that bloggers often have an inordinate amount of power.  In my opinion, money is a much more important factor, and I think that proof of this is found in the John Lott case.  Even though John Lott committed an offense that was much worse than Bellesies&#8217;s error in a book on the gun rights issue, his book was not attacked successfully; one should note that the pro-gun lobby is backed by an industry that makes millions, but the anti-gun lobby does not have any businesses or industries behind it.  No one makes money if guns are illegal.</p>
<p>One reason why attacking powerful and monied institutions is far more dangerous to a historian&#8217;s career than flouting ethical standards is that the ethical standards are weak and rather pathetic, a point noted in Wiener&#8217;s conclusion.  For example, Wiener states that &#8221; [Weinstein's] offer  to consider requests does not satisfy the AHA requriements of  &#8216;free, open, equal, and nondiscriminatory access [to historical material],&#8221; but the word &#8220;requirement&#8221; seems strong when the statement says that &#8220;historians <strong>favor</strong> free, open, equal and nondiscriminatory access.&#8221;  Indeed, many of the sentences in the Statement contain such qualifying words as &#8220;favor&#8221; and &#8220;should,&#8221; which appears to be the American Historical Association&#8217;s favorite word.  If the writers of the statement were trying to indicate more moral authority, they could have used words like ought, must, or shall, but they chose to qualify almost all their statements  and include loopholes.  In the Weinstein case, the Statement on Standards says that the association &#8220;[recognizes] the legitimacy of restricting access to some sources for national security, proprietary, and privacy reasons,&#8221; giving several ways for a author witholding information to justify his or her refusal.  Overall, I believe that Statement on Standards gives an outline of what all historians would like other historians to do, but it appears that the American Historical Association does not have the authority to force any historian to be professionally responsible.</p>

					<p>The decorum that is associated with academia, and history in particular, regards itself with a degree of elitism, that when infringed upon, can cause a great deal of problems, both for the professional and the profession. The examples in Mr. Wiener’s Historians in Trouble illustrate this point quite clearly. Divulging into the nitty gritty of the scandals that have rocked the profession over the past decade or so, Mr. Wiener does a forth rights job of showing that the historical profession is not immune from the problems of politics, fraud, or lying. However, there are a number of areas where his analysis is quite biased and or not fully developed, such as the brief discussion of plagiarism. Regardless of this, one of the most interesting points that he raises regards oversight in the historical profession.<br />
	  While the changing dynamics of the historical have rendered multiple layers of accountability, it seems, as put forth by Mr. Wiener, that there is a great lack of accountability. In some cases, such as in the Fox-Genovese Case, there was a  lack of accountability at the university level. While not strictly related the history, this case begs the question that if Emory University, a prominent and well respected institution, cannot have sufficient oversight in it’s administrative affairs, then how can it be held accountable for the accuracy or veracity of its professors and their works. In other cases, such as that of John Lott, blatant fraud should have been caught by the various levels of publishers and university presses. Finally, in the case of plagiarism where there was not a university press or university, i.e. the Stephen Ambrose, the accountability of professional review and sanctions by the American Historical Association was lacking. While the layers and levels of accountability are present, the action is not.<br />
	  History as a profession, requires oversight, otherwise myth, legend, lore, fallacies,  and gossip will replace fact.  Much like the debate regarding accountability and oversight in the medical profession, questions are raised about who should control the oversight and when there is too much oversight. These are the questions that will define both the historical profession and its esteem. In my opinion, it is up to the American Historical Society. While enforcement may become an issue, the AHA should be the firewall from which history is protected, simply because its sheer size gives it prevalence and credence. I have no illusions that incidents will continue to occur like those in Historians in Trouble, it is both frustrating and disturbing to see the systems and safeguards put in place simply not being used. </p>

					<p>When I was in middle school, the woman who taught computer classes gave us a list of basic rules for appropriate behavior in the computer lab, and pointed out that common sense rules applied as well: just because none of the rules explicitly stated &#8220;do not put peanut butter in the hard drives,&#8221; that did not give us carte blanche to put peanut butter in the hard drives, or jelly on the monitor. And reading over the AHA guidelines at times caused that same sense of &#8216;well, <em>obviously</em>.&#8217; We discussed in class that we&#8217;ve been taught that plagiarism is wrong since second grade or so, and were shocked and a little intrigued that professional historians &#8211; even those not monitored by any one academic institution &#8211; would ever think it was okay to disregard that.</p>
<p>Common sense, and common decency: don&#8217;t steal someone else&#8217;s work. It seems like one of those basic understandings, but having read Jon Wiener and followed it up with the AHA guidelines, apparently it&#8217;s something that bears repeating as often as we hear it. Because although it&#8217;s on the syllabus for essentially every undergraduate class at the university, every professor seems to read that section aloud and comment that just last semester, it was an issue. What I find particularly interesting in the AHA&#8217;s section on plagiarism, however, is the emphasis added after depictions of some possible consequences: &#8220;<strong>The real penalty for plagiarism is the abhorrence of the community of scholars.</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p>This sounds like a terrible fate, of course, for any historian. Blacklisted, demonized, held up as a case example. Forever wandering alone in an intellectual desert, the pariah of academia. But a more cynical view immediately sprang to mind after reading Wiener: the view that this could be the AHA&#8217;s worst of all possible endings solely because in the real world, plagiarism is not punished nearly as harshly as it is inside History 307 or English 102 classrooms.</p>
<p>Doris Kearns Goodwin, after plagiarizing and paying out a good deal of hush money, was able to revitalize her career. Jayme Sokolow, never publicly admonished for plagiarism, was able to sell two plagiarized manuscripts even after AHA involvement. It could be that the (sometimes temporary) scorn of one&#8217;s peers is the &#8220;real&#8221; penalty for plagiarism only because of institutional impotence and inability to combat plagiarists.</p>
<p>Something that did interest me in the AHA guidelines was the emphasis on the often subjective nature of history, and the statements that ethical protocol did not necessarily dictate neutrality. The view that &#8220;multiple, conflicting perspectives&#8221; are a fundamental part of changing discourses on history was a welcome  one, especially as we&#8217;ve talked extensively about bias and its limitations in class. This sanctioning of interpretation within common sense guidelines (ie, don&#8217;t twist facts to suit your thesis, don&#8217;t invent a national poll that never took place) offers room for differing perspectives, which is fairly exciting.</p>
