<p>Ahhhh… familiar ground!<br /><br />This book, Archive Stories, presents fifteen essays around the theme of archives.  Part 1 is primarily about users&#8217; experiences, Part 2 is primarily about the development of some particular archives, and Part 3 is primarily about the political ramifications of popular perceptions of archives and their objectivity.  I say primarily because most of the essays in each Part touch on the other two emphases as well.<br /><br />The overall point that comes through all of these stories is that archives are not repositories of objective facts that can be used to establish a single, irrefutable truth.  In their selection, organization, accessibility, and limits, archives themselves are subjective, even before users begin to interpret their artifacts.  This inherent subjectivity needs to be explained more clearly because the evidence in archives—primarily of the written variety—is being put on a pedestal and given authority that can then be used to perpetuate unfair power relationships.<br /><br />I loved the stories in this book, even when I wanted to argue with their interpretations.  The authors gave little snippets of their own research as context for the points they were making, so I got to visit India, Uzbekistan, New Zealand, San Francisco, the Civil War, France, Germany, Russia, Edwardian England, Wisconsin, Egypt, Soweto, British Columbia, and Australia, each with a chatty and thoughtful guide and an archive perspective.  <br /><br />There were, however, several times I wished that the archivists could have contributed their sides of the stories.  Schadeo interpreted inadequate finding aids as deliberate attempts to exclude researchers.  Robertson was downright whiny about being denied access to people&#8217;s private information.  And Milligan seemed almost to ridicule the requirements for specificity in document requests.  Each of these situations has a legitimate reason behind it—archivists (as a rule) don&#8217;t hoard their collections to thwart researchers; they do the best they can within the limitations of time, space, and budget.  They also have excellent stories about the quirks of their patrons, which professional ethics require them to never share, unfortunately.<br /><br />The concept of archive was interpreted quite fluidly throughout.  Robertson said it was a procedure, not an institution, and gave a great etymology of the word.  Ramirez used it for the single collection of one person&#8217;s oral history.  Sentilles said the internet both is an archive and contains archives.  Milligan sees them as a synecdoche of the state/citizen relationship.  Fritzsche says, &#8220;Every soul possesses an archive…&#8221; (184)  Mayhall shows a human body being used as an archive.  Booth presents novels as archives of an alternate view of history.  She also uses the term in ways that I couldn&#8217;t figure out, as does Perry.<br /><br />I had dozens of thoughts as I read these essays (and kept track of the times they mentioned  &#8220;power&#8221;, &#8220;foregrounding&#8221;, and &#8220;Foucault&#8221;) but my biggest question is about how these collections of essays get put together into a book.  Every single essay very self-consciously refers to others in the collection, so apparently they all had each other&#8217;s as they were writing.  But in responding to those others&#8217;, they changed their own, so the other authors then had old versions.  This process is a lot more interactive than I&#8217;d previously realized, and I wonder if that&#8217;s a new thing because of the capabilities of the internet.<br /><br />Which brings me to the other book:<br /><br />I was initially proud of myself for remembering the second, electronic reading for the week, but this smugness dissipated quickly when I realized it was an entire book instead of an article.  I don&#8217;t like having to read from a screen, so I was regretting not having paid for a paper version.  As I got into it, though, dismay made way for growing appreciation for the advantages of an electronic format (that disturbance in the force you feel is my husband&#8217;s glee at this statement—he&#8217;s been dragging me, shrieking and spitting—into the 21st century for years).  I liked the footnotes that you can click on, and the expanding table of contents.  I liked that I could scroll through each section without having to wait for new pages to load, but that each section was on its own so the blue button wasn&#8217;t excessively sensitive.  The lack of page numbers was a little disconcerting, though—how do you cite a quote from this?  And, for my second-ever attempt to type my reading notes, it proved to be much more wieldy than the paper book that refused to stay open.<br /><br />Format aside, the content and writing style were fantastic.  The authors include information that I&#8217;ve wondered about for a long time, in a non-threatening and succinct way.  They note the downsides of electronic publishing as well as the benefits (like Sentilles in the other book).  They organized the information clearly and they explain it gently, as though they realize that humanities people are less likely to jump into technology than their geeky spouses.  If I ever want to go digital, this book will absolutely be my primary resource for doing so.<br /><br />I particularly liked the section of Fair Use, which has always seemed vague and intimidating.  They did a good job of showing why it seems vague, and then provided a nice little pep talk for why we should be more courageous in using and sharing other people&#8217;s work.  I&#8217;d never thought about the interpretation of a law evolving in response to people&#8217;s assumptions, but I can see how this is real.<br /><br />The Final Thoughts seemed to be written just for me, with comments about being deliberative and tentative and perfectionist.  By respecting my reality, they make it easier for me to consider theirs.  I never expected to enjoy a computer book, but this one—even read from a screen—was wonderful.  I&#8217;m even thinking of parting with cash in order to have it in paper.  And yes, I do see the irony in that instinct.  It just seems more real (and less ephemeral, by the way) if I can hold it and scribble in the margins.  Just because I&#8217;m coming to appreciate the advantages of computers doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t still see the advantages of paper.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-4204031510749253549?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
