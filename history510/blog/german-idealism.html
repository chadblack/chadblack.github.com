<p>Ok, the first thing I have got to say is, Thank goodness these papers were easier to follow than the book from last week.  I understood what they had to say, and could discern an outline or structure to their thoughts.  Very refreshing and reassuring.<br /><br />Hegel began by looking briefly at various kinds or styles of writing history—original, universal, pragmatic, critical, and transitions—before introducing philosophical, where he then focused his attention.<br /><br />The foundation for his philosophical history is basically neo-Platonic.  Universal Reason is both the guide and the substance of the Universe.  This Universal Reason is progressing toward an Ultimate Goal by way of successive waves of human events and eras.  Seen this way, from a perspective of Universal Progress, particular events that would seem tragic can be interpreted as brief and necessary steps toward an Ultimate Good.  Humans contribute to this progress inadvertently as they pursue what they think are their individual goals.  Reason uses these human acts to accomplish the Ultimate Goal.<br /><br />On page 36, his said that Philosophy is the process of figuring out what this Ultimate Goal is, so we can correctly interpret the events of history and thereby see—prove—that &#8220;the real world is as it ought to be&#8221; (36).  Seeing this Real perspective makes the ordinary, &#8220;incoherent&#8221; events fall into a Reason-guided cycle of progress, or Universal History.  And then he said that the State—law, morality, government—is the only arena in which this progress is made; it is &#8220;the Divine Idea as it exists on Earth&#8221; (39).  Because the State provides structure and constrains impulses, only it provides the setting for this Universal Progress.<br /><br />On page 52, he mentioned that people are as limited by their time as by their location, but he didn&#8217;t indicate that this applied to him.  I refuse to give into the temptation to feel superior here, because he&#8217;s right.  And it applies to us just as much as to him, except we theoretically understand it, without being able to identify our limitations any more than he could his.<br /><br />By page 54, he&#8217;s ready to use all these ideas to look at the Course of the World&#8217;s History, though still at a theoretical and anonymous level.  He said that though growth and development in Nature proceed uneventfully, in the Spiritual realm they&#8217;re filled with conflict because there&#8217;s both the lure of the currently obvious goal and the inevitability of the Ultimate Goal.  Sometimes the current goal seems thwarted, but that&#8217;s an error of perspective—everything that happens leads closer to that Ultimate Goal.  Upheavals throughout history have been the transitions between a settled and achieved Spirit of One Age to the onset of the Spirit of the Next Age.  The upheaval is good, because States need a new goal to work toward in order to avoid becoming listless and flaccid, or being overrun by the private goals of individuals.<br /><br />Throughout this section, I watched him peel away huge areas of history that must be disregarded for one reason or another—India focusing on distinctions instead of unity, China focusing on individual happiness instead of State good.  But even this didn&#8217;t quite prepare me for the outrageous prejudice in the Geographic section.  In order to qualify as part of his Universal History, you need the proper climate, suitable natural resources, the correct religion, sufficient group identity, an interactive geographic position, and so on.  Basically, you need to be Protestant Europe.  His thesis works great as long as you ignore everything that doesn&#8217;t fit.<br /><br />Hegel&#8217;s thesis is indeed Idealistic, and more than slightly self-congratulatory, but it does sort of hang together as long as you wrap your mind around his very provincial worldview.  I can see how people would have loved to see Progress in terms that excused or explained horrible events.  But it seems an awful lot like children&#8217;s Christianity, rephrased with philosophical vocabulary:   Don&#8217;t worry, God has it under control, everything happens for a reason, it&#8217;s His will, and so on.  I don&#8217;t see, though, how it was supposed to help historians to organize and understand large bunches of apparently disparate data, other than by ignoring most of it.<br /><br />Kant is obviously on the same page, but in a delightfully brief version.  He also focused on large groups over individuals, assumed a goal that creation is moving toward, put human actions in service to this Universal Goal, and said that the State—or society—is the only arena for progress because social restraints provide freedom.<br /><br />He does focus on individuals more than Hegel did, though, especially in thesis four.  There, he said that humans are drawn into social groups, but within those groups we still seek our individual will, so conflict is inevitable.  On a smaller scale than Hegel, he reiterates that conflict and striving are better for progress than is ease and concord.<br /><br />His other point of difference is that he identifies this Ultimate Goal as a single coordinated league of all Nations.  When everyone is constrained by the same set of expectations, all our competitive nature will go toward human development, instead of toward competition and destruction.  All of the wars and chaos now are necessary to guide us toward this universal State that will be the Goal of history&#8217;s efforts.<br /><br />Again, Kant is very idealistic.  He specifically pointed out at the end that philosophers offer this perspective to augment the empiricism of historians, not to replace it, which I found to be more realistic than saying it&#8217;s a good way to actually write history.  There are a lot of people who do see life this way, though they use different terms to discuss it.  Understanding that this worldview may be involved makes it easier to infer motivations for behaviors we run across in research.<br /><br />I read von Ranke first, so I saw him distancing himself before I knew what he was distancing himself from.  Now when I look at his insistence on facts and proof and accuracy, I see why he was so adamant.  He focuses on archives because he wants to know what happened, not how events can be interpreted into a shape that fits this theory of Universal Progress. And he believes people drive history in a much more intentional way than Hegel and Kant describe it.<br /><br />He stressed over and over that different times and places must be evaluated for themselves, based on their own events and character.  Eventually, on page 250, he summed up the value of considering a universal scope of history, but he still insisted that we use particular events, and let them dictate the shape of this meta-story, not the other way around.<br /><br />Despite being clearly oriented differently from the others, he does use phrases like &#8220;peoples have developed in unison and along similar lines&#8221; (57), &#8220;the development of the unity and the progress of the events&#8221; (58), &#8220;private collections…[are]…not to be compared with the riches of the state archives&#8221; (62-63), &#8220;a portion of the history of the world, and of the general progress of mankind&#8221; (66), &#8220;truth can be but one&#8221; (72) and so on.  I see how people could think he was part of the Idealists.  But in the section from page 101 on, he insists on particulars and eyewitnesses, and says that pieces of history fit into a Universal History on their own terms, not within the constraints of a preconceived theory of Progress.  He did have a new and important contribution to make, and I&#8217;m glad he insisted on being heard.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-4516265652637414399?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
