<p>The Emperor&#8217;s Mirror: Understanding Cultures through Primary Sources was an incredibly helpful and accessible book focusing on ethnohistory, particularly, and historiography, generally. It was in many ways a how-to-guide for beginning historians, detailing methods, theories, and possible pitfalls that those in the field would benefit from being familiar with. It introduced various ethnohistorical terms, particularly in part I: &#8220;Concepts,&#8221; although definitions were sprinkled through the next two sections, as well. The Concepts chapter established the theories to be occasionally referred to in the rest of the book (such as various assumptions and the use of models). It goes through the changing definitions of ethnohistory and finally settles on &#8220;an interdisciplinary field that studies past human behavior and is characterized by a primary reliance on documents, the use of input from other sources when available, a methodology that incorporates historiography and cultural relativism, and a focus on cultural&nbsp;interaction&#8221;(12). </p>

<p>This section also defines different approaches and philosophies behind ethnohistory and explains the importance of models to clarify ideas. Some opposing approaches are emic vs. etic(using the world-view of the subject or the historian as the basis for analysis), particularist vs, nomothetic(using specific case studies or looking at broad, generalities), or personal influence vs. social forces as the chief determinant of individual actions or events(16-17). After this, it examines particular assumptions that some ethnohistorians make, also in diametric pairings. Ideationalist vs. materialist and conflict vs. consensus are two examples of assumptions used to explain the supposed driving forces behind all human actions(19).  The final section of the book, &#8220;Strategies&#8221; summed up the practical application component of this book as a directive for successful research topics. Barber and Berdan manage to offer their suggestions delicately, carefully qualifying their findings as possibilities for other scholars to&nbsp;consider. </p>

<p>The Methods section, which makes up the bulk of the book was the most engaging for me, personally. While the other two sections were certainly helpful, this section was filled with not only recommendations for scholarship but also intriguing examples. The case studies at the end of the chapters were applied well to the topics previously discussed, but I thought the examples given in the rest of the text were actually the most enlightening, some examples of which I have decided to mention: The complex nature of pictographs was clearly exhibited, as was the varying nature of alphabetized language(53-66). I really enjoyed the sections on spelling, names, spellings, and calendars. I was fascinated to discover that ten days were removed from history and that the ten days were different in various places due to the centuries it took to convert all of Europe to the Gregorian calendar (October 5-14, 1582 according to the Pope, December 10-19, 1582 in Paris, France, not until the 18th century in America, pages 82, 86).  I similarly had no idea that many of the spelling changes that differentiate American and English spellings can be traced back to the decisions of one individual, Noah Webster. I had also often thought that certain spellings clearly favor some dialects over others (for example, based on my Rochesterian accent, I always want to spell emperor &#8220;emporer&#8221;), but it was interesting to see this validated in this book, as Barber and Berdan note of the language codification efforts of the William Caxton in 1476 who admittedly chose the London accent as his&nbsp;base(67). </p>

<p>Source Analysis was also a helpful part of this book, detailing not only physical and content analysis for spotting forgeries, but also for designating a source&#8217;s value. This was followed by discussion on the benefits, possible pitfalls, and methods of quantitative analysis, then visual sources, with maps in its own chapter. Then, in a fitting final chapter of this section, the book discusses recognizing complementary sources and combining one&#8217;s analysis to utilize both.  As mentioned before, the examples used throughout this section made it more enjoyable for me to read and made historical study seem once again like an exciting pursuit, not just a daunting&nbsp;task. </p>
