<p>The pen is mightier than the sword, and the footnote is its stab to the kidneys.<br /><br />I have a slight personal bias in favor of this book, because I love footnotes and the snarky things historians sometimes insert.  I have been at conferences where I watched two scholars who have engaged in a war of footnote words act incredibly cordially to one another then mutter asides to their cohorts after they move on.  The footnote as a tool for commentary is one of the things I most enjoyed about my undergraduate education, and when I purchased Anthony Grafton&#8217;s text, I was excited to learn more about it.<br /><br />Grafton makes a couple of early points that have been my own understanding of footnotes, apparently antiquated: as he says, &#8220;A hundred years ago, most historians would have made a simple distinction: the text persuades, the notes prove.&#8221;<a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" title="" href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5106592513198462604&amp;postID=6337084089811826577#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>  This is apparently horribly outdated, as the text is where the notes and studies are stuffed, with only the barest source material in the footnotes.  I prefer the narrative nature of footnotes in someone like Gibbon, whom he rightfully lists as the master of the craft.  I like footnotes to be rich, miniature essays in their own write, exhorting me to further research on a very specific point and giving me starting materials from which to expand. <br /><br />The footnote changes history.  It changes the way we think about history.  The great medieval and classical histories are written by people who either experienced the events or interviewed people, or, in some cases, checked other books, but they don&#8217;t systematically cite or attempt to prove—it is assumed that you trust them, which leads to things like Geoffrey of Monmouth&#8217;s magnum opus.  With footnotes, as Grafton points out, you have to look at the history being written through the lens of a historian; there are credentials being stated, and a modern worldview, and a detachment.  A historian records history, he isn&#8217;t the one creating it.<br />The fallibility of footnotes, which Ranke dealt with in relation to Renaissance histories, is one of the things that scares me when it comes to academic texts.  I know that a good editor and publishing company will at least check to make sure that all citations are factually correct, but sometimes when delving through history texts I wonder about the myriad sources and citations.  Ranke managed to discover vast falsehoods, and I assume that the trend of scientific history has prevented the kind of widespread shenanigans exhibited in older texts, but it makes me a little paranoid at times.<br /><br />Ranke&#8217;s issue with the footnote mirrors one of my own.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong—when I read a history book as a scholar, I revel in footnotes.  I like to write them down, and go look up the other sources and suggestions later to further my own education, and I enjoy the discussion of methodology, historiography, etc. that can accompany them.  That being said, I sympathize with Ranke&#8217;s plight, and I sometimes wish for the unbroken narrative given by older, footnote-less texts.  The use of appendices and endnotes can mitigate this to some degree, and I&#8217;ve read a number of popular-format history books that do this.   In the end, I&#8217;m of split minds, because the scholar half of me hates to be without copious footnotes, but the reader prefers it greatly.<br />I love how Grafton takes the history of the footnote, and the history of history attached to it, and traces us back through a series of famous figures that I&#8217;ve actually heard of to explore how long historians have been obsessed with factuality, with delving into primary sources and supporting their work.  While they may have been exceptions within their own time, I have been under the impression that carefully documented history was a modern obsession solely, a product of the need to prove the workload that went into an article or a monographs creation.  Happily, this was a false assumption, and the footnote, or at least document-based history of the critical and well-supported nature, goes back through the early modern period.<br /><br />This book does a number of important things.  Firstly, it forces the reader to reevaluate the purpose, history, and meaning of footnotes.  They are not just dry citations, but an entire discussion within themselves that speaks volumes about the authors training, methods, ideological approach, and in the best of them, his rivalries within his field.  Secondly, it provides a good historiography of historical scholarship, in its many forms and stretching from the modern era back to the antiquarians of the 16th-17th century, and tracing back to antiquity to look at the ways in which the Greco-Roman world did history.  As a book, it is a fine introduction to historiography all on its own.  Thirdly, it shows how vital archival work and delving into primary sources really is.  I&#8217;ve always been excited about the idea of finding new things to write about, but this book made it very clear how vital actually going to archives is, not just trusting republications of them.  Connected to this is a paranoia about secondary sources, that you must carefully analyze every source you come into contact with.<br /><br />Grafton laments the decline of the footnote into glorified citations, a sad fate for such an interesting means of communicating information.  If nothing else, this interesting book has me promising  not waste good footnotes on such a boring purpose—cite, yes, but comment as well.<br /><br /><a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" title="" href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5106592513198462604&amp;postID=6337084089811826577#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Anthony Grafton, The Footnote (Cambridge, <span class="caps">MA</span>: Harvard <span class="caps">UP</span>, 1997), 15.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-6337084089811826577?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
