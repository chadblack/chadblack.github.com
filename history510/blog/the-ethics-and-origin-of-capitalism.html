<p>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism<br /><br />This was a charming read, but it made me very grateful that the age of corsets and upper-class certainties is over.  Weber tried so hard to be scholarly and objective, and yet the overwhelming impression is of someone holding forth in the smoking lounge after an Edwardian dinner party.  <br /><br />He said on page 29 that this would be a serious work and not a sermon, on page 30 he holds his tongue about genetic causes because they didn&#8217;t yet have evidence, on page 45 he promised to leave behind &#8220;vague and general concepts&#8221; (Ha!), on pages 47-48 he claimed to look at examples before defining the Spirit of Capitalism, on page 91 he limited his goals and claims, on page 182 he rejected &#8220;judgments of value and faith&#8221; and he ended the book with a call for further study, all of which suggested a work of careful and thorough scholarship.<br /><br />But throughout the work he tossed in jewels like the imaginary workers&#8217; &#8220;congenial&#8221; life being &#8220;destroyed&#8221; by a capitalist (66-68) ,which he defended in the endnote by saying it was &#8220;of no consequence&#8221; that it was imaginary (200).  On page 73 it&#8217;s &#8220;hardly necessary to prove&#8221; that this work ethos wasn&#8217;t present before the rise of Protestantism imposed it.  (Since proving that is the point of the book, I started smelling brandy and cigars again.)  In chapter three he outdid himself:  &#8220;…dimly felt rather than clearly perceived…&#8221; (81), &#8220;…hardly necessary to point out…&#8221; (82), and &#8220;…unnecessary to go into detail…&#8221; (83).  After that I lost interest in collecting these little baubles, but I do wonder if some of the mind-numbing pages of details and proof in other books is a reaction to the blithe opinionating of Weber&#8217;s era.  If so, I&#8217;d like to call for a little moderation—support your points with actual examples instead of fancies, but don&#8217;t describe every example to death.  And please cite your sources; that&#8217;s a fabulous innovation that I&#8217;ve loved and taken advantage of for years without truly appreciating until now.<br /><br />Ok, scholarship aside, his book did try to make some interesting points.  If I lace myself up and accept his sloppiness, I can see where this would have been an exciting innovation a hundred years ago  The distinction between amassing wealth for consumption versus for reinvestment is instructive (and rather remarkable considering the conspicuous consumption of the Gilded Age).  He tossed in the idea that Calvinists&#8217; frequent refugee status may have influenced their approach to economics, but he didn&#8217;t do anything with this.  His generalizations on pages 59-61 about people working only enough for subsistence echoed last week&#8217;s book, yet it also seemed like justification for poverty wages.<br /><br />I only know a little about Luther, but Weber&#8217;s presentation of him supporting passive acceptance of your lot in life does fit with that scrap.  It was interesting, on page 89, that he admitted the original Calvinists didn&#8217;t advocate amassing wealth as an end.  This means he&#8217;s considering other religions at one point of development, and Calvinism at a different point.  I am more familiar with Reformed theology, and from that position I have to say that either he found some obscure little slice to examine, or else he just ignored inconvenient realities in favor of stereotypes and myths that supported his thesis better.  Confession and forgiveness have always been central, in one form or another, and predestination (before the unfortunate addition of double predestination) was a bedrock assurance of salvation irrevocable by any error or omission on the part of the sinner.  His comment in the Anabaptist section about asceticism being a denial of joy in this life also contradicts all I&#8217;ve read and heard on that subject.  Everywhere else, it&#8217;s a means of intensifying and focusing a deeper joy.  So, his chapter on religion was wrong except where I don&#8217;t know very much.<br /><br />Chapter five, where he pulled together all of his opinions to prove his theses did hold together well, if I suspend a lot of disbelief.  There was a pervasive sense of duty in the 19th century, though I never saw it as denominationally limited.  I do have a sense—as unproven as his—that Southern planters were more leisurely and New England manufacturers were more uptight, but I always figured it was the climate.  And his claim that once Calvinism had established the capitalist ethos it became unnecessary for its perpetuation was very clever.  That eliminated all sorts of arguments based on present (even his present) realities.<br /><br />However vague and opinionated this book was, it has the gracious advantage of being lightweight and entertaining.  At this point in the semester; it&#8217;s nice to have a little charming recess.<br /><br />The Origin of Capitalism: a longer view<br /><br />In this book, Ellen Meiksins Wood mentions and refutes several explanations of capitalism&#8217;s rise, shows the elements that other explanations got right, and then gives her idea of what caused the shift to capitalism and how it then was able to spread around the globe.  Throughout the book, she is occasionally defensive and consistently repetitive, but despite those shortcomings she presents a clear and convincing argument for what really distinguishes capitalism from previous systems, and how it was set in motion, however inadvertently.<br /><br />To avoid her repetitive habit, let me just say that her recurring complaint against Commercialization, Demographic, and World Systems/Dependency Theories as well as the Sweezy/Dobbs <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Hilton Debate was that they all assumed that the development of capitalism was natural and inevitable.  They described various ways it developed, obstacles that had to be removed, and varieties of development, but none explained how it began, because they all assumed that it just did.  Sort of the &#8220;if you remove the obstacles, it will arrive&#8221; theory.  They also—to one extent or another—assumed that people naturally choose greater productivity and wealth when given options, not the greater leisure and familiarity that Weber suggested in his high wage/low wage example.<br /><br />She listed as well the people from whom she pulled pieces of her theory.  Karl Polanyi, Karl Marx, Perry Anderson, Robert Brenner, and <span class="caps">EP</span> Thompson all got glimpses of her reality even though they each fell short in one way or another.  My favorite part here was in the Perry Anderson section where feudalism was described, very drily and objectively, as the union of political and economic control.  David Lewis (in God&#8217;s Crucible) called it the greatest protection racked every perpetrated by the powerful against the weak, or words to that effect.<br /><br />Finally, she distilled all their contributions into her theory.  Basically, England had centralized political power and localized land ownership.  Because the landowners couldn&#8217;t squeeze surplus by force, they charged rent, and eventually figured out that they could maximize their wealth by making rent competitive—giving land to the highest bidder.   This introduced increased productivity, which led to many pieces that combined into capitalism, well before industrialization or large and free cities in England.  The competition led to many people being driven off the land, becoming landless wage workers in London.  The greater productivity meant that the fewer remaining farmers could still feed the country despite the population explosion that seems to always follow advances in agriculture (even as long ago as Cahokia in 11th century North America). The mass of workers meant that industry had to develop efficiently to provide their basic needs cheaply.  The central location meant that the market was unified and therefore competitive.<br /><br />She briefly mentioned that England also had the best-developed transportation network that also supported this transition, but she never considered how England&#8217;s distance and humongous moat might have influenced its different development.<br /><br />She did spend some time with the 17th century&#8217;s fascination with &#8220;Improvement.&#8221;  She says this new focus grew out of the new need for productivity and competition, not from fear of not deserving your salvation like Weber claimed.  This makes a lot more sense, frankly, since so much of the Protestant Revolution was about throwing off the vestiges of having to earn your salvation. She also showed how this idea had developed from as far back as Thomas More in 1516, and how it was used to justify both enclosures at home and colonial appropriations abroad, all under the delusion that they were actually contributing more value to these communities, not stealing their livelihoods.<br /><br />She ended by saying that post-modernism is the latest school to conflate capitalism with something else, this time Enlightenment values.  Because they&#8217;re intertwined, post-modernists want to overthrow the benefits of the Enlightenment in order to overcome the negative consequences of capitalism.  Only as we understand what capitalism truly is, apart from all the things that developed alongside it, will we be able to see a way to replace it with a more humane system.  And what capitalism truly is involves economic coercion by The Market, instead of military coercion by force.  Capitalism compels productivity just as insistently as previous systems compelled conformity to their needs.<br /><br />My last observation (complaint) is about her endnotes.  They would have been much more helpful if they&#8217;d included a very brief description of what we&#8217;d find if we tracked down the citations she provided.  She created in the text proper questions and hopes for examples or specifics that just are not answered by looking at the name of the source where they could be found.  I&#8217;ve never been a fan of &#8220;look it up; you&#8217;ll remember it longer&#8221; and this was a case of just that.  She also didn&#8217;t have an alphabetical bibliography, which I missed.  <br /><br />I hadn&#8217;t realized until this week what an endnote Goldilocks I am.  &#8220;Give me details, but not piles of them.  Give me facts, not stories (in the endnotes—I like stories in the text).  Give me sources, but not in place of answers.  Craft your endnotes to my specifications so they&#8217;re Just Right.&#8221;  (&#8220;Please.&#8221;)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-5605347416899612936?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
