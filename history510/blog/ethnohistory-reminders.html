<p>Barber and Berdan&#8217;s The Emperor&#8217;s Mirror is a book that I thoroughly enjoyed reading. I spent a semester as an Anthropology major at Tulane, after my year-long foray into Theatre and before I made the final switch to History, so I enjoyed reading about ethnohistory as a discipline—the combination of anthropology and history (yes, yes, I know it can be a combo of a dozen other things too) was one that felt relatively comfortable to me, even though my anthropology background is now six years behind me. Wow. I&#8217;m feeling a little old.<br /><br />The first part of this book, while overly basic, was actually very helpful to me. From what I can tell, this is really an introduction to the field, the kind of thing you would use as a textbook in an introductory ethnohistory class, but, frankly, that made it more valuable. My anthro skills are rusty, so having them refreshed was nice, and the terminology used helped me continue fleshing out my own identity as a historian. I didn&#8217;t need primary and secondary sources redefined for me, but the terms they used afterwards… well, I&#8217;m apparently more interested in personal influence than social forces, though I recognize the value of the latter and use it quite a bit; I think I&#8217;m also a bit of an ideationalist, though that might just be a backlash at three weeks of materialism—I still understand and value materialism, but I like the concept that human behavior is primarily shaped by ideas, ideologies, and values. Maybe I&#8217;m just naïve. That&#8217;s always a possibility. I&#8217;m also very much a believer in the conflict theory of human interactions, though this is not always the case, and I am very much a stochastic. I&#8217;m so glad that word exists and that I know it now. Chance, chaos theory, random happenstance—oh yeah, that definitely has a role in history.<br /><br />The second section wasn&#8217;t quite as useful personally, though I like that it is a reminder of the wide variety of sources that we can and should use. Obviously, historians know that documents have to be looked at carefully because of bias and what-not, but the number of methods and source types they look at was a good little refresher. The paleography section in particular I enjoyed, as I am really excited for the year-long paleography/history of the book course next year with Drs. Burman and Lafferty. The reminder than pictographs, glyphs, runes, hieroglyphs, etc. are all writing styles, the brief description of ways of writing, the number and abbreviation segments—I&#8217;m going to learn a lot more about all of these, and this section pretty much wet my whistle. The calendrics bit was my favorite, I think—I&#8217;m doing my capstone fro Marco on Anglo-Saxon England, and the debate over the dating of Easter is pretty important in the whole Celtic v. Roman Christianity debate, so a section on the use of calendar and dating systems, and what they can tell us about both history and a people&#8217;s culture was a nice reminder. Linguistics, toponymy, source analysis, etc. were all nice, but they kept reminding me that this really is an introductory book.<br /><br />The book will definitely be something I keep in mind when I start teaching—I think it could be great for an undergraduate course, like an Intro. to Historical Study or something like that—the chapters are useful introductions to the use of a variety of sources, the appendixes were fun, and the bibliography had a number of texts I want to check out later. It was pretty basic, though, so I was hoping for something a bit more in depth when I turned to the articles. Also, I have to admit that I didn&#8217;t see how different ethnohistory was from the kinds of work I already try to do; maybe that means I&#8217;m just doing a better job than I thought, or maybe I just missed the point—I don&#8217;t think so, though.<br /><br />&#8220;Other Times, Other Customs&#8221; by Marshall Sahlin, an article on the anthropology of history, is a lovely little piece, which begins by reconciling cultural/social history with political history, arguing that the political history of kings, the so-called &#8220;big man theory,&#8221; only works out because of the cultural construction that gives them so much power, allowing them &#8220;a disproportionate historical effect.&#8221; I thought this was a neat little argument. He also argues essentially that heroic figures and kings are social constructs, that even if they do exist they are really markers of cultural concerns and interests, given power in order to represent specific things to the culture they come out of.<br /><br />Sahlin looks at a wide variety of cultures to construct his arguments, mostly Pacific Islanders compared to the Western world—Fijians and the Myceneans, Maori and the Greeks, interactions between the islanders and colonizing powers, etc. His final argument is in favor of a historical anthropology, essentially ethnohistory, but with an anthropological focus rather than a historical one.<br /><br />The other article, the first chapter of Clifford Geertz&#8217;s The Interpretation of Cultures, looks at culture as &#8220;webs of significance&#8221; around man, and Geertz attempts to construct a way of looking at the meanings of culture beneath their enigmatic surfaces. He discusses the basics of anthropology in this section, which was a useful refresher of my Intro. to Anthropology class from my freshman year. He discusses what ethnography is, and argues that it is less observational and more interpretive, regardless of what people might believe, and that analysis, therefore, is a very important part of what anthropologists do. He defines culture as what people do, and sees behavior as a symbolic act, arguing that the only important question as a result is &#8220;what their import is,&#8221; what any act of culture says about the group.<br /><br />His mention of cognitive anthropology brought up unpleasant memories of the class that caused me to drop the Anthro major.<br /><br />Geertz&#8217;s article, to me, was more helpful than Sahlin&#8217;s. I like in Sahlin&#8217;s that he uses a wide variety of cultures from different areas, but otherwise the article did very little for me. Geertz&#8217;s article was a refresher course, on the other hand, and reminded me a number of things I used to know about anthropology. I think anthro. is a very useful tool for a historian, and I&#8217;m looking forward to this week&#8217;s discussion.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-2970167261381314840?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
