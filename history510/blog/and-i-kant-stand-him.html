<p>Oh, German Idealism and its major proponents. I am afraid of Kant and Hegel, of German Idealism in general. Until doing these readings, I had very little knowledge of who they were or what they stood for, or even how they fit into historical thought, but I knew that Hegel was nigh-incomprehensible, and Kant was the founding father, and that was enough.<br />It&#8217;s sad that you&#8217;re taught to fear Hegel before even reading him.<br /><br />Now that we&#8217;ve actually read some of Kant&#8217;s work, I have a much better sense of why he is important, even if I have some questions. He clearly believes, in these theses, in some sort of destiny, racial if not individual— Kant&#8217;s second thesis, the idea that humanity as a whole is going in one, unstoppable, progressively more rational direction regardless of individual actions seems a bit… well, optimistic, really. The idea that humanity in any way can head towards rationality seems, in the modern world, to still be a pipe dream. Technology may improve, but people in general are still as stupid, paranoid, prone to violence, and superstitious as ever. The fact that he doesn&#8217;t think individuals head towards rationality proves its idealism, not lunacy, to support his theories, but I think individuals do have the power to change the course of human history in their own way. I wonder what he would think of that.<br /><br />Kant&#8217;s fourth thesis, though, made me feel a lot better, and relax while reading this. <span class="caps">OK</span>, there is the ideal vision that humanity as a whole is improving, but humanity improve via antagonism—the old argument of progress through war in philosophical form. The idea of creating a perfect civic state, which he argues for, doesn&#8217;t seem to work with this idea, but he admits it to be the greatest problem and goal in human history. This, he believes, is the driving force in human history—the irrevocable progress towards a single civic society where all men live under the rule of law.<br /><br />The general idea of German Idealism, that the way we perceive the world around us reflects us, rather than the universe, makes a lot of sense to me. Maybe I&#8217;ve watched the Matrix too many times, but reality is basically what we perceive, regardless of whatever may be lurking behind. If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around, does it make a sound? The real question, in my opinion, is does anyone care? And no, for the record—we don&#8217;t perceive it, it didn&#8217;t happen. I&#8217;ve got Kant et al.&#8217;s back on this one.<br /><br />Hegel&#8217;s piece opened with his discussion of the three kinds of history: Original, Reflective, and Philosophical. I&#8217;m a sucker for Original History. Herodotus, Thucydides, most of the good stuff—deeds and events and states of society? Narrative of the universe around them and their experiences? My favorite kind of sources. I love primary documents, or secondary documents close enough to the source to still be mostly eyewitness. Reflective history is history that transcends a specific time period—a universal history, like Livy, or a pragmatic history, dealing with the present, or a critical history, historiography. Not the best, nor my favorite, though certainly useful in all three forms. And philosophical history… well… a thoughtful consideration of history, as Hegel says, is a good thing, but after last week&#8217;s book, I don&#8217;t really like this philosophical history, or the philosophical traveler, or any of that nonsense.<br /><br />Not nonsense. That&#8217;s unfair. The book <em>How to Write the History of the New World</em> was just so convincing that I find myself prejudiced against 18th century Enlightenment historians and their theories, and against the concept of philosophical history and travelers. I don&#8217;t believe that there are universal laws that can be applied to all of history, or even to the entire nature of the universe. Chance, chaos, whatever you call it, have a very real part in events—history is not predetermined, history is a mutable object. Maybe it is my lack in the belief of predestination that makes me argue against any kind of knowable history, but I don&#8217;t not believe in the inevitability of anything.<br /><br />This relates back to his arguments about Reason in History, in that sometimes things happen by chance, or by accident. Causality can be established, but there does not have to be logic behind it. There is no &#8220;ultimate destiny&#8221; of the world except for entropy, and the inevitable end of all life makes for either a very poor or a stunningly brilliant guiding factor behind human history. I&#8217;m not sure which it is yet.<br /><br />Now, Hegel&#8217;s piece is really interesting, if so dense as to be actually painful to read. The discussion of Sprit, and how it relates to culture and a nation, was hard for me to understand—I wanted Sparknotes to explain to me what the heck he was talking about. I still don&#8217;t claim to understand it, but the link to religion, and his attempts to reconcile human history with the divine… well, that did make a lot of sense. Evil and God. History is filled with examples of evil, in all forms, from the great to the small, and reconciling the existence of it with an all-mighty, all-good God is one I am not able to even attempt.<br /><br />The idea that history is an expression of freedom struck me as another example of the slightly naïve nature of Hegel and Kant. The spirit expresses its freedom through history? History seems more an expression of repression to me. Man, I&#8217;m feeling like a major pessimist, but really. Slavery, oppression, autocracy, this is the unifying message of human history. Theoretically free societies pop up like a brief dream, and are crushed under the weight of reality. Athens lasted what, 500 years?, before it was brought back under a monarchy. And it was the longest lasting democracy so far. I like to hope we&#8217;ll break the trend, but man. Freedom as the unifying factor in history. Wow. And yes, I know he then says that Freedom as an Idea is natural, and doesn&#8217;t exist in practice, but I don&#8217;t think even in nature, outside of the human condition, there is a natural freedom waiting to burst through. Queen bees, alpha males, pack leaders, etc., nature has a hierarchy, and there is a low, dominated end of the totem pole.<br /><br />Hegel is pretty much what I thought he&#8217;d be. Really important, but I&#8217;ll read secondary sources about him next time.<br /><br />Ranke, after Kant and Hegel, was a breath of fresh air. I already know a little bit about him from Grafton&#8217;s book, and while he&#8217;s a 19th century German author, his ideas about modern source methodology are important, and his writing style was quite a bit easier to grasp. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to talk much about Ranke, maybe in class, but it&#8217;d be interesting to read more of his works.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-3595616783294855512?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
