<p>First reading for my 510 class, William Cronon&#8217;s &#8220;Getting Ready to Do&nbsp;History.&#8221; </p>

<p>I have to admit, I was intrigued by the opening question of what a historian actually does, because I have in the past fallen into the category of those who would have just said &#8220;study history&#8221; and moved on. Really, I know that was a simplistic answer, but I wouldn&#8217;t have bothered to go any further into what I actually mean about that. His long bulleted list of what historians do, the things that link them, and the sketch of what I should, to a certain extent, begin thinking about as a new historian (new as in length of time doing it, rather than the historical school of thought). The last couple of points, especially the continuing emphasis on narrative storytelling, made me very happy, because history is fun and exciting, and should be written that wayâ€”a good history book is just as fun to read as any&nbsp;fiction. </p>

<p>I was also struck by the acknowledgement that history is written distinctly from our modern perspective, that we are constructing history based on our own views, and that this is ok and how we should and will operate. My teachers discussed history not in terms of objectivity but interpretation, but they did try to convince me that my own biases were bad and I should work to defeat them within my own text. I appreciate that it is understood that my bias is part of my text, and that honestly it is an important part. My history texts, my writings, are in the end valuable as a history of my lifetime and my particular context, because my biases and how they come out in my text are important markers of our&nbsp;culture.</p>

<p><br />When reading about the Ph.D. Octopus, I was reminded of a graphic distinction I just&nbsp;saw:</p>

<p><br /><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5613794/what-is-exactly-a-doctorate?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+gizmodo/full+(Gizmodo)">What Exactly Is A&nbsp;Doctorate?</a></p>

<p><br />I miss the era of the Renaissancce Man, where the mark of a good education was being deeply educated in a wide variety of areas. I would love to be able to get Ph.D.&#8217;s in several areas, or at least Master&#8217;s programs, or something of that nature. While I do have a passion for the area of history I am going into, I wish it were acceptable and practical to continue dabbling through higher education. At the same time, you do become theoretically the master of your chosen field, the absolute top scholar in a very narrow area. I know that the techniques I am learning/will learn will allow me to pick up any knowledge I care to study later, I agree that it stifles a bit of creativity within the bureaucratic undertaking of actually getting the&nbsp;doctorate.</p>

<p><br />I found this article on the whole heartening about the profession and the way it is being thought of. I come from a school with more narrow views on the future of history and the historians, and reading this article I felt that there is a very good sense of the vastness of possibility within somewhat fixed but generally free boundaries. While the guild structure of the historian is a real thing, I feel that the guild is shifting, that new types of history and old are both alive and well, and that the community I am entering is one that I will be able to adapt to&nbsp;well.</p>
