<p>Let me start with the article for a change, because usually by the time I get done with blogging about our weekly book I don&#8217;t really have anything left to say, and it gets neglected.<br /><br />The opening discussion on gendered language reminds me of why my French grammar is terrible, despite being a native speaker. My grandparents will never let me live down my rants as a kid about how trees were neither male nor female, and my general disdain for having to learn whether a word was masculine or feminine. Of course, I can now see the phallic symbolism in a tree, and I understand language much better than I did then, but I still hate the way words are gendered in ways that make no sense to me.<br /><br />Gender is a useful category for historical analysis&#8212;it isn&#8217;t the one I&#8217;m most comfortable with, but that is slowly but surely changing. The discussions of gender identity in Gender and Sexuality in Early Christianity, the class I&#8217;m taking with Dr. Shepardson, have been lively and enlightening, and I&#8217;m starting to see how it can be a good direction for me to look at.<br /><br />Gender theory, and its use in history, are areas fairly murky to me, but between the article and the book I have a much better sense of why women&#8217;s history requires such a theoretical approach if it is going to really be women&#8217;s history, as opposed to the kind of panacea described in parts of both texts. The barest mention of women in textbooks without altering the grand narrative of history, the inclusion of &#8220;notable women&#8221; without mentioning the lives of the commoners, and the idea of history as progress are all counterproductive to creating a truly synthetic history—one that takes into account both men and women equally, and uses both of their experiences to create a new narrative structure, rather than grafting on a thin outer layer of equality without really changing anything.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book much more than I thought I would. Honestly, the title kind of scared me: <em>History Matter: Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism</em>. The word &#8220;patriarchy&#8221; has all kinds of really negative, man-hating connotations in my mind, and I appreciate that Bennett toke the time to forthrightly address these kinds of concerns. I don&#8217;t disagree with her definition of patriarchy, a social system that is inherently man-centric, or the use of feminist theory and critique in history being to show that, within a social group under the same circumstances, women are disadvantaged in comparison to men. It was a really nonthreatening way of going about it.<br /><br />I think what I found most useful about this book was not the actual feminist theory; I&#8217;ve been exposed to it before, and while this text managed to reverse the vision of it I had had before, that wasn&#8217;t really what did it for me (though the historical examples were really neat). What I liked best about this book was the way in which it dealt with the historical profession and genre in general. The emphasis on a political use of history, without necessarily returning to the nationalistic genre of history writing or skewing facts, is important to me—mostly because she uses this as a springboard for how to make history, and especially premodern history, relevant. That the kind of thing I wish there was more honest debate about, and I found her discussion, with all the pitfalls waiting for feminist women&#8217;s history in academia and the broader world, refreshing and engaging. The problem of conforming to the academy&#8217;s expectations in order not to be judged amateurish is one that worries me, with my own, personal goals, so it was nice to hear not only her personal experience, but an entire discipline&#8217;s struggle in this way.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-6084614164221970179?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
