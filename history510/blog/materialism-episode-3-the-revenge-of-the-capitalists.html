<p>These readings were a perfect cap for materialism, and I got really into them, much to my surprise. Ellen Meiksins Wood&#8217;s book, The Origin of Capitalism, was a fantastic little read, and I managed to be done with it by the time I touched down in Philadelphia. I liked the view of agrarian capitalism, which she very convincingly portrayed. It is clear, to anyone who studies the medieval world, that trade and urbanization alone cannot be the only factors needed to create capitalism. The Dutch Republic example was very persuasive, and I thought of examples of international trade routes like the Amber Road and the Silk Road, the gold and slaves route through the Sudan during the Roman and Arab periods, the Phoenician trade networks… city-states and trade networks, metropolis and urban societies have existed for a long, long time. If cities and trade were all that were needed, with some industrialization mixed in, why wouldn&#8217;t Byzantium have succeeded?<br /><br />The English agrarian model, which blames the English for capitalism (and yes, I know that was not what she was saying, but over the last few weeks I&#8217;ve started disliking capitalism more and more), makes perfect sense, and the fact that it capitalism creates the proletarian-industrial mix in this theory really works for me. I personally believe agriculture to be the backbone of any economy (yes, I have dark thoughts about the house of cards of Western prosperity as a result), so the agrarian model really touched a chord with me.<br /><br />The line she uses, that production of the basic means of survival being market dependent is the marker of capitalism (p. 140) is a great way to look at it. No choice outside of the system.<br />Max Weber&#8217;s work was a fun read. I&#8217;m not sure what of it I buy, but it was enjoyable and different. Unlike Wood, who argues that capitalism is neither universal nor inevitable, and certainly badly misunderstood, Weber doesn&#8217;t argue the universality or inevitability of capitalism, but looks at the &#8220;Protestant ethic,&#8221; something I&#8217;ve heard about for years—the idea that Calvinism is a direct source of capitalism and the doctrine of prosperity. Given the doctrine of predestination, where you are either saved or not, you have to live like you are—this means prosperity and blessings have to be upon you, and you have to <span class="caps">KNOW</span> you are saved—you have to be so convinced of your self-righteousness that you never doubt it, because doubt is a sign of not being full of grace and thus being damned. The inherent problems with that idea are so vast, and outside of this paper, but <span class="caps">MAN</span> I dislike Calvinism as a theological doctrine. Where this comes into play materially is that you are expected to be prosperous and have a life filled with the blessings of the Lord, so you work hard to keep yourself out of trouble, earn a lot, create something for yourself to show that God has favored you. Just make sure not to enjoy it.<br /><br />These readings were, on an enjoyment level, much better than the last two weeks. I like that they look at different roots of capitalism, and challenge the concept of capitalist inevitability.<br /><br />Good readings, looking forward to the discussion.<br /><br />Oh, and did anyone else notice that Weber said basically that Catholics are all the scholars and Protestants all the business men? I know the second part is his point, but the first? I love it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-3888606977097685145?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
