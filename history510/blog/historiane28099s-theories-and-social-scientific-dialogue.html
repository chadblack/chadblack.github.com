<p>This is it. The last blog post for the class. Weird feeling, actually. Anyway, onto the book: William H. Sewell&#8217;s <em>Logics of History</em>.<br /><br />I thought this was an excellent book to end the semester with. Sewell&#8217;s interdisciplinary work in the social sciences, and his premise of creating a two-way dialogue between historians, who spend more time incorporating outside theories than in propounding their own, and social sciences, who are theory-rich and involved but do not incorporate useful lessons from history. His initial explanation of the general theory that drives most historians was especially useful, because I, at least, do not think about theory as much as I evidently need to, and had not recognized that simply by thinking like a historian I was very much attached to a particular theoretical bent. It&#8217;s funny how that happens, isn&#8217;t it?<br /><br />This theory of social temporality, as he puts it, is very interesting, and he spends considerable time explaining what he means by it in depth. In addition to the fatefulness/sequence of time, he adds the heterogeneity of time and cause as major aspects of the theory—time happens, and can never be recovered (a non-repeatable experiment, if you will), but just because time passes does not mean that it passes the same way in every place, that there are grand systems of human development that are universal, or that there are singular causes that drive all human societies at all times and places. What this leads to is the need to contextualize all things, because they are only meaningful within their own time, place, and culture.<br />This is very different from the kinds of universalist rules sought after by some of the social sciences. Do I even need to mention economics, and how they seem hell-bent on proving themselves wrong-headed? (Thanks for the recession, by the way). Sewell mostly advocates interacting with those disciplines in the social sciences that are already on a historical-cultural bent anyway, like anthropology. Actually, he really only mentions anthropology in his first section as a whole, though he mentions that dissident scholars within sociology and other social sciences, though clearly within the minority of their fields, would also be welcome in the dialogue. He points out the two major things that the social sciences can contribute: a use of structure that gets discarded by historians, and a willingness to tackle major issues, time spans, etc.<br /><br />His second chapter, remarking on his own historical journey and the shift from social to cultural history, was interesting. Fairly useful, too. I tend not to use quantitative assessment in my own work, but I think it would be a good think to start looking into—social history&#8217;s use of data in that sense, to help build a more complete picture of the marginalized through numbers, would help in medieval history, where charters, legal documents, tax records, etc. still exist and can make up for the dearth of narrative sources, especially in the County of Tripoli, where I&#8217;m working. Shipping records, etc.? Might be very useful. Note to self.<br /><br />My favorite sentence, dealing with the change from social to cultural history, and why I would like to know more about both, is on page 51: &#8220;If social history tended to privilege quantifiable data as uniquely objective, cultural history, at least in its post-structuralist modality, seemed to deny the possibility of access to any realities beyond the discursive structures present in the text.&#8221;<br /><br />Now, I will admit that the first two chapters were the ones I found most useful and thought-provoking (I especially liked the areas commenting on French historiographic trends, if only because I am French). Chapters three and four I had a harder time with, not because of any inherent flaws on their part, really, but because I have no experience with sociology, at all. I understood the difference between eventful temporality and the other two he mentioned, and I understand the need for a good definition of structure (I&#8217;ve been that naïve student), but I had a hard time following past that, because I was really out of my element. I did not feel like this was a beginner&#8217;s guide to understanding sociology—sadly for me. His theory of structure may or may not have been excellent, I just don&#8217;t know enough to make the judgment.<br /><br />When he turned to anthropology, I felt much more comfortable. Really, it mostly made me want to read Geertz and Sahlins in their original forms, which I never did (in my anthro. classes they were mentioned repeatedly, but I was a sophomore, so we didn&#8217;t really get in to the major texts). Having read <em>Ethnohistory</em> recently, I felt like a lot of what he was saying we&#8217;d discussed recently.<br /><br />What I really got out of the book as a whole was the need for more interdisciplinary work, not just as a pillaging of theory from other disciplines, but actual work within in, dialogue with their practitioners, integration and assimilation when appropriate but also editing and criticism for the benefit of all groups. We&#8217;ve discussed interdisciplinarity in this class, and how it is useful for us but not yet within the cards job-wise; that needs to change. Sewell&#8217;s personal journey, teaching in a variety of departments and joint positions, shows it can be done where there is a will and funding, and I think it would benefit students and scholars in all fields to have that expand in the future.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-5028353268995215485?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
