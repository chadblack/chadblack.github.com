<p>Once again we have a long-winded book full of so many trees I can&#8217;t enjoy the forest.  My favorite part of the entire 400 pages was the bit about the women resisting expectations to create erosion control, because I can totally identify.  I don&#8217;t like economics, I don&#8217;t understand economics, and I&#8217;m tired, tired, tired of spending days and days of my life trying to decipher interminable monographs about economics.  It takes so much effort just to find the gist of their articles that I have no energy, time, or motivation left to evaluate or synthesize them.  So, here&#8217;s my hard-won summary, but that is as far as I can go.  I have had it with this book.<br /><br />Chapter one, by Steve Stern, introduced the theme that recent scholarship has evolved away from grand narratives to more localized and specific studies.  This seems like splintering and loss, but opens up the possibility of discussions and resonances.  It put me in mind of the step from singing in unison to parts—it&#8217;s difficult and confusing at first, but eventually yields much richer and more beautiful music.<br /><br />Chapter two, also by Steve Stern, evaluated Wallerstein&#8217;s theories in light of Latin American evidence.  Wallerstein said we have to look at the whole world as a system, the core/semi-periphery/periphery have different labor styles, labor methods determine political possibilities, and capitalism finds the best combination of free and coerced labor.  <br /><br />When Stern tried these out for the silver industry, he found that various labor relations existed concurrently, and while Latin America&#8217;s silver affected the world as expected Wallerstein&#8217;s theories didn&#8217;t explain the world&#8217;s effect on Latin America.  In order to explain Latin American development, you need to include local power sources and their goals, and peasants&#8217; resistance to becoming wage laborers.<br /><br />Looking at the sugar industry showed weaknesses in the periphery equals slavery idea, because slavery was only resorted to after other labor systems didn&#8217;t work, and even within a system of slavery, there were bits of autonomy and accumulation.<br /><br />So, the grand theory didn&#8217;t hold up to focused, detailed, specific examples, because they offered too much variety for a generalized system.<br /><br />Chapter three, the longest and most irritating, was written by Frederick Cooper, who seriously needs some time in a journalism class.  Brevity and succinctness are good things, though apparently very elusive in academic writing.  First, he looked at different grand theories, and how they fared against evidence in Africa.  Neo-Classical scholars have a single model, only one idea for rational motivation so when Africa didn&#8217;t fit it was seen as inadequacy in Africa, and a focus on markets and products instead of the structures and people who influenced them.  Dependence and Underdevelopment models look at a core that drains surplus from the periphery, and define periphery as where surplus is drained from, so end up saying nothing.  Cooper says they have a good idea, but it&#8217;s too crude and general to provide useful insights.  Marxism looks at production instead of markets, and says capitalism didn&#8217;t develop in Africa because they couldn&#8217;t eliminate alternatives to wage labor because about the same time efficiency would have become necessary, transportation advances made the status quo a better option, so no class was able to accumulate enough to begin the capitalist cycle.<br /><br />Then he looked at events across time.  In Gold to Slaves he said that slavery was a method of controlling the populace in addition to being a source of funds and power, and it didn&#8217;t require excluding others from resources so it didn&#8217;t lead to the accumulation necessary to start capitalism.  In Slaves to Peanuts, he looked at merchant capital and their need for peace instead of the violence that had supported the slave trade.  Imperialists had as much trouble controlling the populace as African leaders had had, so once again, capitalism didn&#8217;t develop as the theories had predicted.  In Agriculture and the Colonial State he looked at many attempts to corral the African people into their role as wage laborers and how those attempts have failed.  Local leaders only knew domination and plunder, so they weren&#8217;t good partners; the enforced peace gave workers new options to avoid becoming wage laborers, and they consistently preferred food crops and autonomy to cash crops and subjection.<br /><br />Then he provided many more pages of examples of ways Africa didn&#8217;t fit the tidy European model of Marxism.  His basic point is that Africa has too much available land and too much peasant resistance for the standard sequence to work.  Capital in Africa has had to create new goals and strategies in order to salvage any kind of success. <br /><br />His conclusion was—shockingly—that previous ideologies had imposed our schemata on African situations, but since Africans have different circumstances and priorities, European ideas don&#8217;t support their history.  <br /><br />Chapter four, by Allen Isaacman, was about peasants in Africa.  They resisted colonialism&#8217;s imposition of commodity production in a variety of ways, based on the different circumstances and positions of each sort of peasant.  After looking at some examples of this resistance, he considered acts of retribution, a la Robin Hood.  These made statements, and relieved resentment, and occasionally led to policy changes.  Songs, jokes and other cultural contributions provided a perception and identity that supported actual acts of subversion and so are also a form of resistance.<br /><br />He looked at conflicts within peasant communities as well as peasants against rulers, though even here he said that the imposition of colonial/capitalist expectations intensified those conflicts in many ways.  As young people and females resisted elders and males, they got experience and confidence to resist other forms of power.  Organized political resistance developed when everyday forms of subversion were no longer possible.  A good area for study is how peasants act to organize their resources for these concerted rebellions.<br /><br />Chapter five, by William Roseberry, looked at peasants in Latin America, and how research has evolved over the years.  In the 1960s people asked questions about the peasants instead of considering questions of the peasants, which cast them as props or victims instead of as actors.  Researchers lumped all peasants together as those oppressed by colonial powers, and assumed some recent upset that had instigated the current upheaval and suffering.  These sweeping universals ignored varieties and missed insights that come from closer, deeper looks.<br /><br />Historians and anthropologists each have something to contribute to the study of peasants in Latin America.  As they communicate and swap ideas, they&#8217;ve come to a regional focus that allows a good balance of specificity ad connection, and also uncovers new sources of data.  Looking at variations in haciendas and coffee production has already produced new insights and led to new questions.<br /><br />He concludes by saying that studies need &#8220;historical and sociological content&#8221; (359) in order to substantiate their conclusions and theories, and gives evidence that this is beginning to happen.<br /><br />Chapter six, by Florencia Mallon, summarized and synthesized the other chapters, and called for the next big idea.  She said there had been two scholarly revolutions within her career, the one in the 70&#8217;s moving from world to local, and the one in the late 80&#8217;s going from communities to sub-groups like feminism and such.  They&#8217;ve both challenged previous assumptions and over-generalizations, which was helpful, but they&#8217;ve left scholars with no way to organize their findings.  Now it&#8217;s time to find new theories and structures to guide inquiry, but this time these scaffolds need to be written in pencil as supports instead of in pen as mental cages.  After a whole book that showed the inadequacies of overarching ideas, she ended by saying that researchers can&#8217;t just eliminate structures because they&#8217;re the way to turn discrete data from particular cases into coherent narratives that provide insight and significance. <br /><br />Then she spent some time comparing various studies and articles to show how their differences could inform and strengthen each other.  She added subaltern ideas from India as another source of perspectives that would strengthen productive dialogues.<br /><br />So, after 400 pages, we have: old over-generalized theories don&#8217;t work in Africa and Latin America.  Once researchers looked at specifics they found more exceptions and variations, and so they need new ways to consider their data.  Communication between areas and disciplines will provide richer ideas and questions, and lead to a more elastic and accurate overarching theme.   Color me underwhelmed.  And cranky.
