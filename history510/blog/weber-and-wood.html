<p>The Origin of Capitalism presents a very interesting argument that capitalism, often assumed to be the natural result of social/economic progress, is in fact neither an inevitable outcome nor is it likely to be the permanent one. Ellen Meiksins Woods distinguishes between market opportunity and market forces, as she argues that compulsion more than opportunity directs interaction in capitalist exchanges(7). This idea that individuals in a &#8220;free&#8221; capitalist society are actually compelled by market forces acting on them is thoroughly explained and well-supported. She roots much of this shift in England tenant farming, where rent competitively determined land access. The farmers themselves had to improve production to be allowed access to the land to garner subsistence. The need to constantly improve production relative to one&#8217;s fellows, however, shifted the focus from subsistence to profit. The reason for this change among the peasants was &#8220;not the opportunity to produce for the market and to grow from petty producers into capitalists, but the need to specialize for the market and produce competitivelyâ€”simply in order to guarantee access to the means of subsistence and to the land itself&#8221;(53). This was contrasted to other countries, such as France, which could rely on extra-economic coercion(96, 100).Wood states explicitly on page 80 that this shift in social property relations that made individuals dependent on the market that generated capitalism. Capitalism is, however, unstable to its core, since it is based on continual growth and consumption in an ultimately finite world(85). Wood directly expresses her concern for the continued viability of such as system in the&nbsp;conclusion(198-98).</p>

<p>Wood acknowledges Weber&#8217;s interpretation of capitalism, noting that he also implies capitalism&#8217;s inevitability as it is only absent in cultures where particular structures impeded its implantation. She notes that his analysis also furthers his goal of &#8220;distinguish[ing]Europe from other parts of the world&#8221;(17). This is not what most struck me about Weber. I found his argument about the changing attitude toward work the most interesting of his ideas. There is unquestionably a break between Catholic and Protestant teachings on the role of work in society. In Catholicism, faith and good works together are required to ascend to Heaven after death, but in Protestant religions, an individual gains salvation through faith alone. However, one&#8217;s profession ought to be to the glory of God, as opposed to a less congruent sample of good works accumulated throughout a lifetime, as Catholics were believed to do. He argues that to Protestants, one&#8217;s profession was one&#8217;s &#8220;calling,&#8221; which necessarily took on a religious character(28-30). He also notes, however, that Catholics are more likely to become master craftsmen, which I do not see how that bolsters his&nbsp;argument.</p>

<p>Weber&#8217;s attention to the fact that Luther translates work in different ways is very important to his argument and a sound historical observation(55). However, there were many other places throughout the book where I felt he lacked historicism. In addition to  his clear bias toward certain religions, he also failed to fully explain his own analysis, insisting that definitions are better left until later or that &#8220;this is not the place for&#8221; further inquiry. I disagree with the editor that the shifting nature of his terms and lack of concrete definitions or explanations allows him to &#8220;constantly elude refutation&#8221;(xxiv). I did not think historians allowed one another to avoid peer criticism by being deliberately vague. Weber spends a section of the work talking about the individual Protestant sects, but then, as he is relating them back to his thesis, insists that one(Calvinism) will be sufficient to demonstrate his point. After taking time to highlight the differences within Protestantism, he then discounts it(105). It was an interesting idea that individualism has its roots in Calvinistic doctrine, since each man is fully on his own, and no one can help him gain salvation, but I do not think he adequately supports his claim that this is the foundation for the spirit of capitalist. It may be a contributing factor, or an intriguing psychological parallel, but I am not convinced that it is the sole genesis of this all-encompassing worldview(which I would also argue, we still have yet to adequately&nbsp;define).</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading the two together (and enjoyed reading Wood) because Weber certainly falls into one of Wood&#8217;s criticisms that we consider capitalism the fated conclusion of economic development; Weber could not be more triumphalist in his examination of capitalism than coupling its birth with the Protestant Reformation, a movement he clearly&nbsp;supported.</p>
