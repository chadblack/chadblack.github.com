<p>I&#8217;m glad we read Hegel before Marx, so I could see why he presented his materialistic interpretation of reality in such a defensive way.  Materialism seems so obvious to me that his attitude would have been perplexing if I&#8217;d not understood what he was challenging.  Marx rejected the idea that concepts have independent reality, let alone intentionality, and began his theories with the fact that humans exist and that they have material needs in order to continue to exist (like Maslow&#8217;s Hierarchy).  Because he begins with those needs, his worldview is based on production and ownership—everything is about economics.<br /><br />In &#8220;German Idealism&#8221; he took several digs at Hegelians, saying that they began in heaven with ideas (154), that consciousness grows from life, not vice versa as they claim (155), and that History has no intent or self-consciousness (172).  But on page 162, he said that communism is an ideal that reality needs to conform to, which seemed more than slightly Hegelian to me.<br /><br />He had many ideas that made sense, but I never could follow his leap from This is how things are and how they should be instead to This change can only happen by revolution.  Where did revolution come from?  He made that argument several times, and every time I felt like there was a step or two missing, like the old Far Side cartoon where the scientist&#8217;s formula includes &#8220;here a miracle occurs&#8221; to get from one step to a disconnected result.<br /><br />&#8220;Wage Labour and Capital&#8221; was my favorite section.  I&#8217;d never thought of labor as a commodity—usually that word is used for grain, or to distinguish commodity chemicals from specialty chemicals—but it made a lot of sense once he pointed it out.  I do think he ignored the presence of specialized labor, though, and only focused on a certain kind of worker.  I suppose they were a bigger part of society then, and they were living through an appalling period in the development of industrialization, but even in Marx&#8217;s time, they weren&#8217;t the only people working for a living.<br /><br />I also appreciated his comment that capital is accumulated labor.  It&#8217;s perfectly clear once he points it out, but I&#8217;d never thought of it in those terms. He seemed bitter that workers are paid less than the value they create with their labor, but ignored the fact that they&#8217;re only able to create that level of value because of the capital investments that provide them tools and materials with which to be so productive.  They were certainly oppressed, especially then, but he made it seem like they were the only generators of value.<br /><br />After al the dense, economic verbiage, it was astonishing to read his bit of poetry on page 216, with the uplifted arms.  That was an amazing image, with beautiful language.  God star for Marx from the writing teacher!<br /><br /><br />&#8220;Capital&#8221; had some good points, but they were hard to see through the glaze that kept creeping over my eyes.  I really don&#8217;t like economics.  I&#8217;m hoping that everyone else focused on this one, so I can see how many points I found, and what the others were that flowed past my brain on a torrent of too many words.  And saying that suggests that this is a good time to comment on Postone&#8217;s chapters, which were also a torrent of too many words. As near as I could tell—both times I tried to read this (ok, I left the pdf on the screen, so that may have contributed to my struggles)—it seemed like all he did was rearrange and describe Marx&#8217;s writings.  I could never find where he was extending or uncovering or adding to anything Marx had said.  I&#8217;m really looking forward to the class discussion for this.<br /><br />&#8220;Crisis Theory&#8221; was interesting.  Over-production is really just over-pricing, so if you lower the price, you have the right amount.  It seemed like a convoluted way of explaining supply and demand, cast in terms of the oppressed proletariat who can&#8217;t afford to buy all they need.  I thought of Henry Ford, paying his workers enough that they could afford to buy the cars they were making.<br /><br />He had a lot of interesting thoughts about how money changes barter, making it less direct and tangible, and introducing new options for disrupting the circulations of capital.  Money makes the social element of trade more abstract so we don&#8217;t see it in its real terms.<br /><br />&#8220;Origin of Family…&#8221; seemed the least thought out of the selections we read.  I didn&#8217;t see any proof of a matrilineal origin, and he didn&#8217;t explain the change to patriarchy very clearly, just saying &#8220;as wealth increased&#8221; (735) like that made the whole thing obvious.  Over the course of the article, he showed that patriarchy arose as part of inheritance concerns, but he never showed why inheritance concerns became an issue.<br /><br />His vision of communism transforming oppressive monogamy into free love, unshackled by concerns of inheritance, sounded like someone who&#8217;s never actually been married.  I&#8217;m sure there are marriages based on inheritance issues, but that whole structure seems like medieval royalty machinations, not 19th century capitalist behavior.  It was interesting to follow his thought to the idea that proletariat marriages were more likely to be about love because they&#8217;re not hampered by concerns for inheritance.  Usually the proletariat are presented as helpless, hopeless brutes.<br /><br />The other prediction that seemed unrealistic and starry-eyed was around the state.  Since its only role is to protect the Haves from the Have-nots, once the laborers realize the present system isn&#8217;t inevitable, they&#8217;ll rise up and eliminate classes and with them the need for a state.  That just doesn&#8217;t make sense in so many ways, even without thinking about how communism  really played out.<br /><br />All through this essay, I kept wondering if Marx had spent any time in the back of a micro bus painted with peace signs.   I know it&#8217;s chronologically impossible, but the ideas, the lack of coherent connections, the free love and lack of authority—I just kept smelling patchouli.<br /><br />And then, in a sudden jerk backwards, he channeled Hegel on page 759, to leave us with a vision of &#8220;the next higher plane of society to which experience, intelligence and knowledge are steadily tending.&#8221;  After all the digs against German Idealism, that was a bewildering way to close this book.<br /><br />So, I&#8217;ve actually read Marx now.  He had some good points and interesting insights, as well a whole lot of unrealistic idealism.  My biggest question is, How does this relate to the study of history?  He was consistently economic, and frequently sociological, but only occasionally historical.  Casting history in terms of economic dialectic and class warfare seems very limiting—an interesting fad to dabble in briefly, but whose primary contribution was just to wrench historians&#8217; minds back to humanity, away from abstractions.  Thank goodness we have seminar coming up to make all of this clearer!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-3829563745520457472?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
