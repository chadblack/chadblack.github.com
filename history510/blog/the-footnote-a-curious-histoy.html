<p>Anthony Grafton provided many definitions of footnotes throughout this book, beginning with, &#8220;[they] offer the empirical support for stories told and arguments supported&#8221; on page vii of the preface, and ending with &#8220;[they] enable[ ] historians to make their texts not monologues but conversations, in which modern scholars, their predecessors, and their subjects all take part&#8221; on page 234 of the epilogue.&nbsp; In between, he even referred to them in sacramental terms, on page 24.&nbsp; But this book did much more than simply define or dissect the small print at the bottom of the page, the reward—or not—for breaking your attention to the main text.&nbsp; He used the development of, and changing attitudes toward, footnotes as a guiding theme for looking at the evolution of historiography itself, or at least one strand of it.&nbsp; By following his trail, I was led to visit several eras of thought around how to write history, and I was introduced (or re-introduced) to an entertaining variety of thinkers.<br /><br />Grafton opened his journey with a visit to Edward Gibbon, whose snarky footnotes put him in a class with Bierce, Twain, Fields, and others.&nbsp; This was an appropriate beginning not only as an incentive to further explore what could have seemed an arid wasteland of parentheses and Latin abbreviations, but also because it foreshadowed Grafton&#8217;s own use of witty analogies and clever wordplay.&nbsp; Besides comparing footnotes to a sacrament, he mentioned Ali Baba&#8217;s cave (x), swarming anthills (9), seas of lemonade (12) pigs and geese (35 and 37), thrift shops (39), armored vehicles (56), William Morris wallpaper (111), hitchhiking (135), and alchemy (199).&nbsp; I very much appreciated seeing that academic writing doesn&#8217;t have to consist of convoluted, passively voiced, pretentiously worded sentences.&nbsp; He was clear and interesting as well as informative.<br /><br />He seems to have two main points that he&#8217;s making with his survey of footnotes throughout history.&nbsp; One is that they tell a different, but equally important story than the one presented in the main text.&nbsp; The text tells the history of the subject at hand, and the footnotes tell the history of creating that text above.&nbsp; His other point is that our modern footnotes have a much more interesting genealogy than their current business-like practice would suggest, sort of like that Rockwell family tree, where little perfect Johnny has all sorts of interesting scalawags in his background.&nbsp; <br /><br />Today&#8217;s footnotes &#8220;convince the reader that the historian has done an acceptable amount of work…[and] indicate the chief sources that the historian has actually used.&#8221; (22) Occasionally they provide interesting additions to the main text, but often they&#8217;re bare citations.&nbsp; I mentally cheered when I read Hume&#8217;s comment on page 103 that flipping pages only to find nothing entertaining is a frustration that needs to be remedied.&nbsp; I was thinking along the lines of different typeface for the numbers that refer to citations or to commentary, but his idea of citations at the bottom and good stuff at the end would work as well.&nbsp; Clearly distinguishing between the two roles of footnotes might encourage more creative use of the second role, too.<br /><br />After beginning with Gibbon, the first chapter considered German arrogance and Positivism, then compared ancient helps to today&#8217;s footnotes.&nbsp; Biblical and classical glosses, fifth-century legal writings, and Peter Lombard&#8217;s citations have elements in common with our current expectations, but fundamentally were included to help a limited reader approach and understand an authoritative text, not—as now—to show the ingredients of a text that has a particular and contingent perspective to add to the many valid voices on its topic.<br /><br />The sections on Ranke were dear to my librarian&#8217;s heart.&nbsp; Its always fun to meet someone who loves not only the treasures in an archive, but even the basic act of sifting through the detritus to find them.&nbsp; And the chapter about Enlightenment excesses was wonderful.&nbsp; I love the cheeky, droll, irreverent parodies he described.&nbsp; They reminded me of Flanders <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Swann, a musical duo with the same dry wit.&nbsp; I&#8217;d never thought about footnotes for fiction, but I like the idea, sort of like parenthetical asides on an official scale (I&#8217;m a big fan of parenthetical asides).&nbsp; Chapter five zipped through several people to show how respect for accuracy in the details developed over the years, even as admitting to the process of ensuring accuracy was kept hidden from the reader.&nbsp; Chapter six, too, showed growth in careful scholarship still being kept behind the literary green baize door.<br /><br />Finally, in chapter seven, Grafton shared the tale of Pierre Bayle&#8217;s dictionary, and how it made footnotes in scholarly works not only acceptable, but even desirable.&nbsp; Bayle took pride in being a compiler, not a historian, of presenting facts and sources, not opinions and conclusions.&nbsp; This was fitting to the time, as authority came under such fire in the seventeenth century.&nbsp; Authors, along with science, the Bible, and politics, could no longer simply state their position and expect it to be accepted simply because of their position as authority figures.&nbsp; Footnotes lent them credibility by showing why they should be trusted and believed, which is a big part of their role today.<br /><br />In the epilogue, Grafton says, &#8220;Modern history is modern precisely because it tries to give a coherent literary form to both parts of the historical enterprise.&#8221; (232)&nbsp;&nbsp; After showing the fits and starts, the shifting balance between eloquence and accuracy, and other lurching steps on the road to modern historiography, he sums up the story arc and leaves us with a few gentle warnings.&nbsp; Footnotes can&#8217;t do everything we expect them to, they&#8217;re as prone to manipulation as are statistics, and they&#8217;re currently not as stylish as they could be.&nbsp; However, they are our best guarantee of reliability, they show the investigative process of writing history, and they invite readers to become participants in the joys of exploring and sharing the story of human activity.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-1612743359798406769?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
