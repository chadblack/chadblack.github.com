<p>The subtitle of this book is Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism, and Bennett certainly featured both of those topics, but the main point I got from the book is that History Matters.  She almost always couched this claim in terms of it mattering for feminist strategy, but I saw this book primarily as a manifesto for the importance of studying pre-1800 history, even beyond its usefulness to just feminism.<br /><br />It was reassuring to have her insist so often that we study the events in history because they&#8217;re useful for our need in the present.  I seem to recall a previous discussion in class that historians are not supposed to read history in order to find insights for today.  I felt then, and still think now, that that is nonsense.  If you don&#8217;t find patterns and causalities and implications for the events in your historical studies, then you only have a list of facts, like an antiquarian.  If you do find these, they will inform your perceptions of other events and trends, including the ones around you.  So, in answer to her claim that &#8220;this is a book…intended to help us think more generally about history, patriarchy, and feminism,&#8221; (3), I would say she did a better job with the first than the second and third goals.<br /><br />It was interesting to keep a tally of every time she reiterated her claim that studying history could inform current strategy (pages 1,4,5,33 [repeated almost verbatim 42-43], 50, 60, 106, 129, 138, and 154, in case you&#8217;re interested).  Hers is a more focused and political perspective, but by removing just a few descriptors, she makes an excellent case for studying history, period.  &#8220;history provides…long-term perspectives essential to building a better long-term future&#8221; (4), &#8220;I believe that modern history is impoverished by inattention to the premodern past…&#8221; (133) &#8220;The power of [fill in your current problem] in our lives today partly rests, in other words, on our failure to understand how it has worked in past times&#8221; (60) &#8220;If they would look further down the &#8216;long cool corridors of the past,&#8217; [they] would see their short-term data in a different light.&#8221; (106)<br /><br />The past is particularly suited to examining emotionally fraught issues of today, like the patriarchy and feminism that Bennett is interested in, because the distance lends objectivity and dispassion that enable clearer thinking and sharper insights.  That&#8217;s one of the reasons morality tales have so often been set long ago or &#8220;peopled&#8221; with animals—it&#8217;s easier to talk about selfishness over there in them than to recognize it inside yourself.  She returns to this benefit of history less often than the strategy angle, but on pages 52, 146, and 149 she does so quite eloquently.<br /><br />What she did less eloquently, but no less often, was to defend her terminology.  Endlessly.  Women on page 9, objectivity (positivism) on page 14, patriarchy on page 55, and her pet phrase, &#8220;lesbian-like&#8221; all through chapter six.  I wish she could have explained herself briefly and then moved on to her point, leaving the agonizing defense of her vocabulary choices for the footnotes.  In the case of lesbian-like especially, I lost sight of her point, unless the only point of chapter six was to campaign for her new word.<br /><br />Other than that (and the fact that footnote 16 on age 133 didn&#8217;t answer my question) this was an excellent book.  I appreciated its defense of premodern history, I enjoyed the description and analysis of the brewsters&#8217; situation, and I picked up many shiny thoughts to squirrel away for future consideration.  She made a good case for the usefulness of grand narratives and overarching structures even as she pointed out their limits.  On page 131 she hit the nail on the head with the benefit of conventional textbooks—they should only be expected to provide the foundation, thereby freeing the teacher space to incorporate the magic.  And she gave a great testimony to the power of incrementalism and moderation in her story on pages 135-137, about editing that textbook.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-4693696104542897736?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
