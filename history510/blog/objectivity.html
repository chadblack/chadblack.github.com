<p>Mark Bevir&#8217;s article is an incisive look at historical objectivity; supporting the rejection of a &#8220;given past&#8221; and instead rooting objectivity in comparative study. The notion that history can be understood in terms of a &#8220;given past&#8221; has been rejected by Foucault, Gadamer, and Derrida, among others. Humans define things necessarily using present understandings, therefore historians cannot fully divorce ourselves from present assumptions inherent in our logic and reasoning. This means that &#8220;we cannot grasp the past as a presence, and that this threatens the very possibility of objective historical&nbsp;knowledge.&#8221;(329)</p>

<p>However, Bevir argues that &#8220;historical objectivity which relies on criteria of comparison, not on our having access to a given past&#8221;(329). He offers a rejection of empiricists, in line with Foucault, Gadamer, and Derrida, saying that &#8220;we do not have pure experiences. The nature of a perception depends on the perceiver&#8221;(330). However, Bevir does not discount human perception entirely. While any individual perception may be flawed, human capacity to perceive the world around them on the whole is generally reliable(341). I would go further to say that if we discount all human perceptions as inherently without value because they are depend on certain underlying assumptions and on subjective understanding, then we have nothing left to work with and all historical study becomes a moot point. Bevir also cleverly points out that there are underlying assumptions in the hard sciences, as well as the humanities, since all are based on human experience in some&nbsp;way(332). </p>

<p>Central to Bevir&#8217;s argument is a separation between &#8220;fact&#8221; and &#8220;truth.&#8221; He writes that &#8220;a fact is a piece of evidence which nearly everyone in a given community would accept as true (333). This denotes perception and theory as part of the observation. He argues that it is not the historians job (nor is the individual historian capable of) discerning universal &#8220;truths,&#8221; rather we must content ourselves with endeavoring to find what is most &#8220;correct,&#8221; based on available facts and objective&nbsp;interpretation(332). </p>

<p>Bevir then examines interpretations of Locke&#8217;s Two Treatises in accordance with his theory. He also points out the importance of intellectual honesty in remaining objective and advocates the necessity of collaboration at arriving at the best possible interpretations over time. Criticism needs to have a positive replacement to be of value, not simply attempt to demolish previous &#8220;webs of interpretations,&#8221; and historians must respond to criticism without blindly adhering to existing webs, but being open to new interpretations(337, 335). In this sense, I wonder if it would be fair to compare Bevir to Charles S. Peirce, in the idea that knowledge is only possible through prolonged, collaborative&nbsp;effort. </p>

<p>Sections I-<span class="caps">III</span> of Peter Novick&#8217;s book, That Noble Dream, relate to this article in a few ways.  Most obviously, the subject of this work is also objectivity. Novick charts the differing notions and forms of objectivity in American historical scholarship, starting in the 19th Century with the founding of the American historical profession through the 20th Century(16). He also presents a difference between the understanding of fact and truth among some scholars(103). Additionally, in his evaluation of Turner, he also presents a passage from that historian that echoes Bevir&#8217;s arguments for intellectual honesty and having a web of interpretations. Turner argues that a historian is &#8220;the parent of a family of hypotheses; and â€¦he is forbidden to fasten all his affections unduly upon any&nbsp;one&#8221;(92). </p>

<p>Particularly interesting to me was Novick&#8217;s attention to the way various wars have impacted how American historians interpreted objectivity and their role in society. First mentioned here is the drive to promote reconciliation and &#8220;nonpartisan&#8221; views of the Civil War(72). This then coupled with racism as a &#8220;consensual &#8216;usable past&#8217;&#8221; was also tied to Anglo-Saxon heritage and genetic &#8220;evidence&#8221; of black inferiority(74-76). This philosophy was extended backward to revision the history of the American Revolution, as well(82). Objectivity was challenged during and after <span class="caps">WWI</span>, as &#8220;many historians lost the optimism and faith in progress which, as we have seen, had grounded their faith in objectivity. And the war itself became the subject of interminable historical controversy, undermining the faith that professional historical scholarship could converge on a consensual objective truth&#8221;(111). <span class="caps">WWII</span> shattered any moral standing of cultural relativism, some going further to say it weakened the nation against communism or fascism. There was a new interest in finding universal values between times and&nbsp;cultures(284-85). </p>

<p>Finally during the Cold War, there was the creation of Western civ and the claim that objectivity was one of the principle unifying characteristic of this Atlantic world. This sought to distinguish totalitarianism with the freedom of the West(299). Unlike the historical trend following <span class="caps">WWI</span>, the post-<span class="caps">WWII</span> and Cold War &#8220;mobilization of historians&#8221; lasted for decades(302). Important to each of these war periods, however, was the notion that dissent was unpatriotic and the somewhat malleable idea of&nbsp;objectivity. </p>

<p>All in all, the quest for objectivity seems to be a perilous one, particularly when we as historians admit ourselves to be influenced by both subliminal and tacit imperatives of the present. I would tend to agree with Bevir&#8217;s evaluation, that objectivity is attainable by examining evidence based on a criteria of comparison, but would probably qualify it by saying objectivity is most approachable in this manner, but may not be fully attainable. That said, limited objectivity does not preclude a workable understanding of the past, and besides, our biases will give the historians of the next generations additional points to discuss. I don&#8217;t intend that flippantly, as I tend to agree with Peirce, that the more analyses the better, however individually flawed each may&nbsp;be.  </p>
