Post 2: How to Write the History of the New&nbsp;World</p>

<p> Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra clearly illustrates how complex and often bitter debates over credibility shaped the historical writings of the New World. Seemingly each effort at historiography was highly contested and very personal, as questions of intellectual capability and scholarly merit were not only leveled against individuals, but whole societies. Some believed that indigenous people and sources were not to be trusted. Multiple scholars proposed pseudo-scientific studies that the climate of the region disallowed Amerindian credibility since they were inherently inferior people, prone to lying. Others believed that their society was far less-developed, so reports of former grandeur and their own reports could not be trusted. This argument was furthered in many attacks on Amerindians&#8217; system of record-keeping, which did not use alphabetic writing. As Cañizares-Esguerra explains on page 64, &#8220;Since God had transmitted his dispensation through the written word, societies that lacked &#8220;writing&#8221; were considered not only outside the pale of civilization, but humanity as well…Amerindian nonalphabetic scripts were, therefore, considered incapable of accumulating knowledge, which was the foundation of civilization.&#8221; Many reacted against such negative characterizations of the Amerindian societies, though for varying reasons. Clearly this was an affront to the learning and humanity of the societies in the New World and some scholars, particularly from the New World, took offense and strove  to disprove such notions in their&nbsp;publications.</p>

<p> Others sought to defend Spanish conquistadors and colonials, since these dismissals of early Spanish observations also discredited the Spanish accounts as ignorance at best, deluded fantasy at worst. Questions of the capability of the &#8220;Spanish mind,&#8221; were rampant in Europe, albeit often through innuendo. Even within Spain, some scholars lamented the fact that those conquistadors and missionaries who first encountered the Amerindian cultures were woefully inept and their testimony could not be trusted. This led some to believe that all these testimonies should be thrown out and the history to be written anew. The debate over the &#8220;Spanish mind&#8221; also surfaced in other forms: some believed only non-Spanish scholars should write the history of Spanish-encounters with the New World, because only they could have the appropriate detachment(or, to some, necessary intellectual ability). Some believed Spain should adopt the styles of other European scholarly communities to be taken more seriously on the international stage; others argued that Spaniards should reassert their strong humanistic heritage and take precedence in scholarship relating to the Americas. Meanwhile, the scholarly community also quarreled over whether Spaniards should be openly critical of past misconduct or if such airing of dirty-laundry would be inappropriately&nbsp;unpatriotic.</p>

<p>What was actually discovered in the scripts, stones, and other documents seemed secondary to the debate behind who was doing the writing, and it was secondary in the book. There was some attention paid to it, particularly to the Amerindian development of highly complex calendric systems, but not much. This book posed some interesting questions and succeeds at demonstrating how multi-faceted the debate over the history of the New World was at this time. However, it is often repetitive, including reusing whole paragraphs from the introductions in other sections of the book, word for word. It is also often redundant in its arguments and conclusions, to the point that I feel that the book would be more successful with a general reordering of its chapters and&nbsp;sub-chapters.  </p>
