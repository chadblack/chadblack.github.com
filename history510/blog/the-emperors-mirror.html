<p>This book was exceptionally clear and well organized, with lists, and definitions, and everything a control freak with a short attention span could want.  It was liberally sprinkled with clever language and very elementary concepts.  It should have been a very quick read.  But, it was stuffed full of topics that reminded me of various events and situations throughout my life.  The margins of my copy are full of references to these, and most of them I didn&#8217;t write down.  The entire time I spent reading this book, I was visiting classes I&#8217;ve taught or taken, books I&#8217;ve read, jobs I&#8217;ve had, my grandma&#8217;s kitchen, trips I&#8217;ve gone on, and so on.  So, while it&#8217;s obvious that this book is a great overview of and introductions to the field of ethno-history, with extensive references cited for further study, it&#8217;s much less obvious that it also makes a fabulous memory jogger.  Apparently, I&#8217;ve been living as an ethno-historian without realizing it.<br /><br />In between mental field trips, I enjoyed the book for its own sake as well.  A lot of the information was stuff I&#8217;ve either learned or figured out long ago, but in between such momentous revelations like the difference between primary and secondary sources (memory of teaching third grade) were little tidbits like why people were so fond of brown ink long ago (59) which I&#8217;d often wondered about but never looked up, and a handy chart of when different places converted to the Gregorian calendar (86).  I love it when my procrastination is rewarded like that.<br /><br />I also appreciate their structure of giving just a general, introductory orientation of each subject area, and then referring to more complete sources.  This enabled them to cover a lot of ground in a manageable volume, and to provide a very positive introduction for potential colleagues or supporters (like we discussed in class last week about the dangers of becoming obscure and then extraneous).  I found myself thinking several times that this would be a great handbook for public school teachers, because they touch on so many topics that get covered in school, in such an accessible manner.  Even the chapters I expected to dislike (calendars and maps) ended up being interesting, possibly because I knew the least about them before reading.<br /><br />I do wonder, though, how ethno-history, as per the definition on page 12, differs from just plain history.  Is it only in that last phrase, about cultural interaction?  Because the rest of it is pretty much what I think of as history.  Am I in LaLa Land again?  What am I missing?<br /><br /><br />The &#8220;Thick Description&#8221; chapter was interesting and informative, but—probably because of the on-screen format—my notes are a list of random bits, like a magpie took them.  I noted several observations about what constitutes culture, and what ethnographers do.  The clearest analogy for me was comparing ethnography to diagnosing a patient.  You need some expectations and experiences as a frame of reference (sort of like the research design from Barber and Berdan) but you mostly focus on what&#8217;s in front of you, fighting all the while against coloring your observations by those expectations and references.<br /><br />&#8220;Other Times, Other Customs&#8221; was a slog.  Either I was just too tired, or the screen aspect overcame me, or it was poorly written, but I did not tease out a main point that tied it together and gave it a reason for being written.  The last page finally said, &#8220;Anthropologists rise from the abstract structure to the explication of the concrete event.&#8221; (534)  This was interesting and well said, but I missed what the Fiji and Maori stories had to do with it.  I&#8217;m looking forward to discussion, and hoping we&#8217;re about done with pdf&#8217;s.  Although, I read plenty of them for my annotated bibliography and didn&#8217;t struggle…hmm, I&#8217;m leaning toward door number three now.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-8380919064898243132?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
