<p>This has been my favorite book since The Footnote, and for many of the same reasons.  Both books deal with social and cultural themes in a chronological sweep, both use a particular topic as an organizing structure for a lot of wide-ranging information, and both have really fun writing styles.  These are the sorts of books that generated and sustain my love for history.  The biggest difference between them—even more than world versus American scope—is that this book stuffs so much information in that I don&#8217;t feel like I got it all.  I really want to read it again this summer when I can go more slowly, and write down the great quotes and metaphors and bits of irony he sprinkled throughout.  I like language as much as history, and this book was full of both.<br /><br />I did find it kind of ironic and cheeky that in a book about objectivity, he seemed several times to be giving a fairly clear preference to relativism, and thereby rejecting objectivity on two levels simultaneously.  Right away, on pages one and two, he explained objectivity in such overblown terms and outsized expectations that he set me up to be skeptical.  I wondered at that point if he would lead us toward a more reasonable definition of objectivity, but if he did, it must have been after section three.  He also seemed to present objectivity as a goal with an agenda.  First, it would make historians more scientific and professional, then it would prepare citizens to be loyal and patriotic, then it would distinguish us from those ideological communists.  He seemed to lean toward conflating objectivity and absolutism.  In chapter three he said that objectivity forced historians to deny their assumptions, which made them the more powerful for being hidden (84).  Relativism, though, was presented in a positive light, as measured and reasonable and even gracious (401).  The only agenda I found here was a different way to create a universal perspective on history than the path objectivity was pursuing toward that same goal.<br /><br />I liked the connections he made between historiographical trends within and characteristics of culture without.  Before <span class="caps">WW1</span>, historians pushed objectivity as a way to seem scientific and professional, even as science was emerging and Literature and Art were leaving old moralizing for modern invisible authorship.  During and between the wars, relativism emerged both in response to discrepancies forced by wartime compromises and in tandem with developments in Literature, Art, and even Math, Physics, Logic, and Journalism.  After <span class="caps">WW2</span>, objectivity was pulled out again as a way of distinguishing Us from Them—They were forced into ideological positions by repressive governments, but We were free from coercion and so able to write the Real Truth.  I also appreciated that even as he used this artificial periodization, he didn&#8217;t bind himself within it; he showed how trends developed slowly and in the presence of the opposition, so the generalizations I just made were mitigated in the book.<br /><br />He also connected the fortunes of objectivity and relativism to the status of the profession in general.  The clearest place was in chapter nine where some historians objected to relativism because it would damage the field&#8217;s professionalism, prestige, and morale.  That seemed an odd argument since—possibly due to his leading—I see relativism as more honest, and honesty as more professional.<br /><br />Obviously, with a book this full that I liked this much, I could go on and on (keep the groans down, please) but I&#8217;m just going to say again that I loved this book.  I hope the rest of the semester&#8217;s are just like it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-9078666779300531007?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
