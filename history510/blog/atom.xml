                                &lt;p&gt;I think that Sewell&amp;#8217;s comments about the teleological methods of Tilly and Wallerstien offer a very fine definition of the term teleological. It appears to me that he argues that a concept or logic  (as opposed to process) is the locus of teleology. It also points to what is to me the most dangerous type of history: the assumption of an eternal humanity across temporality. This is dangerous because it is both very attractive&amp;#8211;it promises to add gravitas to even the most particular of studies&amp;#8211; and because it obfuscates what history can do. It accomplishes the latter either by the former or by its inverse: it &lt;em&gt;begins&lt;/em&gt; with an assumption about the nature of humans and/or their interactions and uses this to extrapolate meanings either toward or away from the actual&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also appreciate&amp;#8211; though my deficiency in this area limits the worth of such appreciation&amp;#8211; the manner in which he demands a statistically viable amount of phenomena and that, often, phenomena have to be considered in relation to one another, limiting the &amp;#8220;scientific&amp;#8221; context that can be given to particular events. Overall, a fantastic&amp;nbsp;book!&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;In his book, Sewell argues for more dialogue between history and the social sciences, asserting that each has something to teach the other.  He notes that historians often appropriate social scientific theory, but that sociologists, perhaps from a desire to appear as scientific as possible, generally do not adopt the temporal theories inherent to historical study.  His autobiographical discussion of the turn from social to cultural history in the 1980s was very well done, and the personal lens gave the chapter an interesting angle.

                                &lt;p&gt;Sewell, &lt;em&gt;Logics of&amp;nbsp;History&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Sewell ultimately argues for an increased between history and the social sciences.  He picks certain foundational tools of historians, sociologists, anthropologists and other social scientists to provide a more articulated and nuanced approach to explaining the interrelation of the many disciplines.  Historians&amp;#8217; greatest advantage, Sewell asserts, is their understanding of the &amp;#8220;temporalities of social life.&amp;#8221;  In essence, historians understand contingency.  The social sciences&amp;#8217; greatest strength is &amp;#8220;their penchant for &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; thinking.&amp;#8221;  Sociology&amp;#8217;s foundations in theory help social scientists to understand the past and the present according to set of unchanging systems or structures of social organization and&amp;nbsp;power. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sewell argues that history and the social sciences must bend and subject themselves to modification in order to create a unified social theory for all the disciplines.  He calls for a mixture of historians&amp;#8217; understanding of temporalities, sociologists&amp;#8217; commitment to structural explanations, and anthropologists&amp;#8217; recognition of the dialectics of power and culture within societies.   The categories of culture and structure, he asserts, are useful, but they must be modified to accept the idea of temporality.  Everything is contingent, and cultural and structural interpretations must be responsive to that understanding of&amp;nbsp;reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the surface, it is clearly evident that history can benefit from the single causation of sociologists to help winnow our multifaceted strands of causality.  But here again, I think we come back to the issue of objectivity.  If a historian&amp;#8217;s research is driven by a belief in the existence of a fundamental structure of power or society is he not likely to find exactly that because he reads the sources to fit his conclusions?  But it can also easily be argued that because everything is contingent, that the structures are constantly evolving and historical investigations will not find the structures we seek, but their historical counterparts which, while similar, are intrinsically different.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own cautionary reticence notwithstanding, Sewell&amp;#8217;s volume had many engaging discussions—some of which I am sure I failed to comprehend as they were intended.   In particular I enjoyed the discussion of temporality and causality and the shift within the historical profession from the &amp;#8220;new social history&amp;#8221; to a history driven by culture were quite interesting and well&amp;nbsp;written.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;William H. Sewell Jr. argues in Logics of History, that historians, sociologists, and anthropologists all have unique insights into the study of the human condition and unique limitations, based on the assumptions and practices of their respective disciplines. Sewell therefore argues that the most complete and incisive study of social history would be done with due consideration shown to each of the disciplines. He argues that this is in scholars best interest, not only to improve the work done and the quality of the understanding the work would engender, but also because each discipline shares interest in many of the same things, and thus have much to benefit from such academic exchanges. He explained his motives in encouraging such interdisciplinary study due to his personal experience working with scholars of other&amp;nbsp;fields. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest to me was Sewell&amp;#8217;s examination of Geertz. Since we have read some of Geertz&amp;#8217;s work on &amp;#8220;thick description&amp;#8221; in this class a few weeks ago, I was intrigued to read Sewell&amp;#8217;s take on it within this study. Sewell notes first that Geertz is the preeminent ambassador of anthropology to other scholastic traditions, though he is often criticized within his own field. Sewell agrees with the materialist critique of William Roseberry that Geertz lacks sufficient attention to temporality and power relations, looking at cultural practices simply as given and detached from their historical tradition(177). Sewell had previously given this to be the major failing of anthropological study, and the area in which historians could contribute the most to the other two disciplines. Still, Geertz remains very important to historians, which Sewell attributes to the similar interest historians and anthropologists have in studying different cultures. He says, &amp;#8220;History, like anthropology, specializes in the discovery and display of human variety, but in time rather than in space,&amp;#8221;(179-80) or, as we have been apt to say all semester, &amp;#8220;the past is a foreign country.&amp;#8221; Answers pertaining to understanding people who operate from a different set of assumptions is naturally intriguing to historians, whether the subjects of the study are past or present. We are both most comfortable evaluating cultures from some type of distance, looking in from the outside. Finally, I found his case studies at the end of the book to be interesting, though personally I would have been more interested to see one at the beginning of the book and one at the&amp;nbsp;end. &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;When I first completed &lt;i&gt;Logics of History &lt;/i&gt;by William Sewell&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; I was not sure exactly how I felt about the book as a whole. Although I finally came down on the favorable side of the book, this was not one of my favorite assignments for this course; I believe the word that most accurately how &lt;i&gt;Logics of History &lt;/i&gt;struck me&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is &amp;#8220;unexpected.&amp;#8221; From the title, I suppose I was anticipating a book directed more toward developing historical methodology instead of one that aimed to promote interdisciplinary theoretical constructions. This preconceive mindset was a surprising inconvenience proved to be a surprising inconvenience while reading the book, for I constantly had to readjust my expectations and remember to judge the book based on its own merits. I must admit that I enjoyed the setup of &lt;i&gt;Logics of History&lt;/i&gt; quite a lot; having each chapter as a self-contained argument helped divide the book into manageable segments and allowed Sewell to develop the individual points most important to his overall theme.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;On a basic level, I agree with Sewell that social theory needs some reworking in order to be useful to contemporary academics. Beyond this fundamental observation, I most strongly agree with his critique on the problems of social theory and how he proposes to address these issues. One of the biggest problems he identifies is the static nature of social theory in the social sciences, which precludes the possibility of historical change. I believe that incorporating historical concepts of temporality would benefit social theory precisely because, as Sewell says, it would make such structures flexible enough to accommodate the inevitable changes society and culture go through over time. I thought Sewell did an admirable job of arguing for greater incorporation of basic historical assumptions into a working social theory, although my favoritism toward the discipline of history predisposed me to accept claims on the value of historical methodology.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;I also appreciated Sewell&amp;#8217;s ideas on &amp;#8220;social network of scholarship&amp;#8221; that exists amongst the intellectual community of scholars. By this, Sewell simply means that no scholarly work is created entirely independent of &amp;#8220;outside&amp;#8221; works, outside in this case referring to extra-disciplinary. This idea ties directly into one of Sewell&amp;#8217;s basic premises: the need for greater interdisciplinary cooperation between history and the social sciences, namely sociology, anthropology and even economics/political science.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It is his belief in the interconnectivity of these disciplines that drives Sewell&amp;#8217;s search for a more universally comprehensive social theory. Although I agree with Sewell&amp;#8217;s conception of an &amp;#8220;intellectual community&amp;#8221; that transcends disciplinary bounds, I hesitate to extend this argument to the length Sewell does. I accept the assertion that each discipline experiences an overlap of goals and methodology, but these basic similarities should not override more pronounced differences. Historians, sociologists and anthropologists are all trained to look for different things and each pursues its goal in the manner most appropriate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Because of my conviction that each discipline is inherently unique, I also found myself wary of Sewell&amp;#8217;s attempt to create a social theory applicable to each discipline. I am certainly not saying that such a thing could not be done, or would not be useful if accomplished. I am simply not sure that a universal social theory is necessarily desirable in contemporary scholarship. To make such a theory acceptable to all disciplines, the emergent structure would necessarily be characterized, if not entirely composed, of compromises. I cannot help but wonder if each discipline is better off adhering to the form of social theory most suitable to it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-224917761199659649?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;            </content>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;When I first completed &lt;i&gt;Logics of History &lt;/i&gt;by William Sewell&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; I was not sure exactly how I felt about the book as a whole. Although I finally came down on the favorable side of the book, this was not one of my favorite assignments for this course; I believe the word that most accurately how &lt;i&gt;Logics of History &lt;/i&gt;struck me&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is &amp;#8220;unexpected.&amp;#8221; From the title, I suppose I was anticipating a book directed more toward developing historical methodology instead of one that aimed to promote interdisciplinary theoretical constructions. This preconceive mindset was a surprising inconvenience proved to be a surprising inconvenience while reading the book, for I constantly had to readjust my expectations and remember to judge the book based on its own merits. I must admit that I enjoyed the setup of &lt;i&gt;Logics of History&lt;/i&gt; quite a lot; having each chapter as a self-contained argument helped divide the book into manageable segments and allowed Sewell to develop the individual points most important to his overall theme.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;On a basic level, I agree with Sewell that social theory needs some reworking in order to be useful to contemporary academics. Beyond this fundamental observation, I most strongly agree with his critique on the problems of social theory and how he proposes to address these issues. One of the biggest problems he identifies is the static nature of social theory in the social sciences, which precludes the possibility of historical change. I believe that incorporating historical concepts of temporality would benefit social theory precisely because, as Sewell says, it would make such structures flexible enough to accommodate the inevitable changes society and culture go through over time. I thought Sewell did an admirable job of arguing for greater incorporation of basic historical assumptions into a working social theory, although my favoritism toward the discipline of history predisposed me to accept claims on the value of historical methodology.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;I also appreciated Sewell&amp;#8217;s ideas on &amp;#8220;social network of scholarship&amp;#8221; that exists amongst the intellectual community of scholars. By this, Sewell simply means that no scholarly work is created entirely independent of &amp;#8220;outside&amp;#8221; works, outside in this case referring to extra-disciplinary. This idea ties directly into one of Sewell&amp;#8217;s basic premises: the need for greater interdisciplinary cooperation between history and the social sciences, namely sociology, anthropology and even economics/political science.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It is his belief in the interconnectivity of these disciplines that drives Sewell&amp;#8217;s search for a more universally comprehensive social theory. Although I agree with Sewell&amp;#8217;s conception of an &amp;#8220;intellectual community&amp;#8221; that transcends disciplinary bounds, I hesitate to extend this argument to the length Sewell does. I accept the assertion that each discipline experiences an overlap of goals and methodology, but these basic similarities should not override more pronounced differences. Historians, sociologists and anthropologists are all trained to look for different things and each pursues its goal in the manner most appropriate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Because of my conviction that each discipline is inherently unique, I also found myself wary of Sewell&amp;#8217;s attempt to create a social theory applicable to each discipline. I am certainly not saying that such a thing could not be done, or would not be useful if accomplished. I am simply not sure that a universal social theory is necessarily desirable in contemporary scholarship. To make such a theory acceptable to all disciplines, the emergent structure would necessarily be characterized, if not entirely composed, of compromises. I cannot help but wonder if each discipline is better off adhering to the form of social theory most suitable to it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-224917761199659649?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Our reading this week was &lt;i&gt;Logics of History: Social Theory and Social Transformation&lt;/i&gt;, by William H. Sewell Jr. &amp;nbsp;In it, Sewell relates history to a vocabulary of social theory, making historical study more relevant to social sciences and cultural studies, and vice versa. &amp;nbsp;He places Historical events into a theory of social structures in an attempt to answer the question, what can history and social science teach one another? &amp;nbsp;That is a wonderful point of view. &amp;nbsp;Historians should not shy away from utilizing other disciplines to create an accurate picture of whatever their topic may be. &amp;nbsp;Sewell believes that Historians can learn a lot about theories of social structures from social scientists. &amp;nbsp;On the other hand, he believes social scientists can learn something of &amp;#8216;the temporalities of social life&amp;#8217; from historians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sewell&amp;#8217;s idea seems like common sense to me, and it was refreshing to have it set down so eloquently with examples that show the effectiveness of combining the benefits of the disciplines of history, sociology, political science, economics and anthropology. &amp;nbsp;This is a fitting way to close out the semester, as we began the year talking about trends of social sciences mixing with historical practice in search the best ways of &amp;#8216;doing history.&amp;#8217; &amp;nbsp;In short, this is the way I would like to approach history in my own studies. &amp;nbsp;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8880139849602883287-5542582567303135408?l=dixonro.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

It&amp;#8217;s fateful, contingent upon the sequence of events that are complex and historically contextual; they are a mix of continuity and change that happens chronologically.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I believe that&amp;#8217;s the gist of it.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;He then talks about a shift from social history to cultural history, which sounds like a good base for ethnohistory.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I will agree that culture is learned by the individual through the agency of the society, community, or group they are in, and&amp;nbsp;through repeated exposure to a distinct set of symbols – uniforms in the military or wooden shoes in Holland.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Could we not say that academia has a culture all its own as well by employing this definition?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;In chapter 8, he used the French Revolution and the storming of the Bastille as his base for defining historical events.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;To me, it read as what makes an event historical.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Think back to 9/11 as an historical event.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Political and social structures, at least between Al Qaeda and the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; were dislocated.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;There was a cultural transformation with symbolic interpretation; lots of songs, movies, and books. It was shaped by particular conditions.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;There were definitely heightened emotions, and acts of collective action by emergency personnel and people on the street.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It was marked by the displaying of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; flags everywhere, and even the current military actions being taken are its legacy.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It changed the way we think of travel and how airports, amusement parks, and stadiums like Neyland, treat security.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The attacks may have been contained to a few places, but the action left a mark on the nation and spurred action just like the attack on Pearl Harbor, but I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure a nuclear bomb is not in the Middle East&amp;#8217;s future.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;However, this section of the book offers us a good way to look at historical events.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;Like I said, I&amp;#8217;m going to have to re-read most of this, or as the old folks used to say; let it percolate for a while, before I can articulate better the ideas therein contained.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;For now, this is will have to suffice. &lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;This is it. The last blog post for the class. Weird feeling, actually. Anyway, onto the book: William H. Sewell&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Logics of History&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was an excellent book to end the semester with. Sewell&amp;#8217;s interdisciplinary work in the social sciences, and his premise of creating a two-way dialogue between historians, who spend more time incorporating outside theories than in propounding their own, and social sciences, who are theory-rich and involved but do not incorporate useful lessons from history. His initial explanation of the general theory that drives most historians was especially useful, because I, at least, do not think about theory as much as I evidently need to, and had not recognized that simply by thinking like a historian I was very much attached to a particular theoretical bent. It&amp;#8217;s funny how that happens, isn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This theory of social temporality, as he puts it, is very interesting, and he spends considerable time explaining what he means by it in depth. In addition to the fatefulness/sequence of time, he adds the heterogeneity of time and cause as major aspects of the theory—time happens, and can never be recovered (a non-repeatable experiment, if you will), but just because time passes does not mean that it passes the same way in every place, that there are grand systems of human development that are universal, or that there are singular causes that drive all human societies at all times and places. What this leads to is the need to contextualize all things, because they are only meaningful within their own time, place, and culture.&lt;br /&gt;This is very different from the kinds of universalist rules sought after by some of the social sciences. Do I even need to mention economics, and how they seem hell-bent on proving themselves wrong-headed? (Thanks for the recession, by the way). Sewell mostly advocates interacting with those disciplines in the social sciences that are already on a historical-cultural bent anyway, like anthropology. Actually, he really only mentions anthropology in his first section as a whole, though he mentions that dissident scholars within sociology and other social sciences, though clearly within the minority of their fields, would also be welcome in the dialogue. He points out the two major things that the social sciences can contribute: a use of structure that gets discarded by historians, and a willingness to tackle major issues, time spans, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His second chapter, remarking on his own historical journey and the shift from social to cultural history, was interesting. Fairly useful, too. I tend not to use quantitative assessment in my own work, but I think it would be a good think to start looking into—social history&amp;#8217;s use of data in that sense, to help build a more complete picture of the marginalized through numbers, would help in medieval history, where charters, legal documents, tax records, etc. still exist and can make up for the dearth of narrative sources, especially in the County of Tripoli, where I&amp;#8217;m working. Shipping records, etc.? Might be very useful. Note to self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite sentence, dealing with the change from social to cultural history, and why I would like to know more about both, is on page 51: &amp;#8220;If social history tended to privilege quantifiable data as uniquely objective, cultural history, at least in its post-structuralist modality, seemed to deny the possibility of access to any realities beyond the discursive structures present in the text.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will admit that the first two chapters were the ones I found most useful and thought-provoking (I especially liked the areas commenting on French historiographic trends, if only because I am French). Chapters three and four I had a harder time with, not because of any inherent flaws on their part, really, but because I have no experience with sociology, at all. I understood the difference between eventful temporality and the other two he mentioned, and I understand the need for a good definition of structure (I&amp;#8217;ve been that naïve student), but I had a hard time following past that, because I was really out of my element. I did not feel like this was a beginner&amp;#8217;s guide to understanding sociology—sadly for me. His theory of structure may or may not have been excellent, I just don&amp;#8217;t know enough to make the judgment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he turned to anthropology, I felt much more comfortable. Really, it mostly made me want to read Geertz and Sahlins in their original forms, which I never did (in my anthro. classes they were mentioned repeatedly, but I was a sophomore, so we didn&amp;#8217;t really get in to the major texts). Having read &lt;em&gt;Ethnohistory&lt;/em&gt; recently, I felt like a lot of what he was saying we&amp;#8217;d discussed recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really got out of the book as a whole was the need for more interdisciplinary work, not just as a pillaging of theory from other disciplines, but actual work within in, dialogue with their practitioners, integration and assimilation when appropriate but also editing and criticism for the benefit of all groups. We&amp;#8217;ve discussed interdisciplinarity in this class, and how it is useful for us but not yet within the cards job-wise; that needs to change. Sewell&amp;#8217;s personal journey, teaching in a variety of departments and joint positions, shows it can be done where there is a will and funding, and I think it would benefit students and scholars in all fields to have that expand in the future.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-5028353268995215485?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;History. Anthropology. Sociology. Can&amp;#8217;t we all just get along?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William H. Sewell – in his 2005 work, subtitled &lt;i&gt;Social Theory and Social Transformation&lt;/i&gt; – argues that social scientists and historians can and should not only respect one another&amp;#8217;s work; they all have something to gain from an ongoing dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historians get &amp;#8220;social temporalities&amp;#8221;; anthropologists get &amp;#8220;the power and complexity of culture&amp;#8221;; sociologists get &amp;#8220;commitment to explanatory rigor&amp;#8221; (p. ix). And while history has borrowed ideas from the social sciences, the reverse has not occurred with much regularity. Historians, Sewell says, &amp;#8220;have lacked the confidence to become active participants in theoretical debates&amp;#8221; (p. 6).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author, based on the breadth of his self-described experience, certainly is qualified to diagnose and comment upon these dynamics. And for what it&amp;#8217;s worth, based upon my exceedingly limited experience, his observations ring true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, this semester we have spent considerable time discussing major theories of causation. Yet I have loosely inferred that theory (whether social or otherwise) is something several of my classmates have not previously dealt with extensively (whether as a matter of choice or curriculum). I certainly fit into that category. And to give a more specific example, as Sewell examines the notion of culture in Chapter 5, he invokes Saussure&amp;#8217;s concept of semiotics – an idea I have studied, with limited results. It&amp;#8217;s fascinating stuff, but difficult for me to wrap my mind around. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sewell evidently has no such deficiencies. Because of his rich and varied background, he seems to know whereof he speaks. And so it is that the case he makes is not only compelling, but credible. As he presents various events and works as backdrops for possible theories of history, his is seen to be a truly well-reasoned stance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(As a side note, I was especially intrigued by Sewell&amp;#8217;s treatment of &amp;#8220;history&amp;#8217;s little accidents,&amp;#8221; vis-a-vis Sahlins&amp;#8217; account of Captain Cook, in Chapter 7. There&amp;#8217;s a great example of right place, right time becoming wrong place, wrong time. Similarly fascinating  is Chapter 9&amp;#8217;s look at the role contingency – as opposed to necessity – played in helping Marseille&amp;#8217;s dockworker corporation attain and retain a position unusual among France&amp;#8217;s 19th-century working class.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout this work, Sewell drops in countless salient points that serve to further fortify his standing. All in all, he lays out an impeccable case for &amp;#8220;forms of structural thinking that are compatible with historical conceptions of temporality&amp;#8221; (p. 15).&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8399157107533224051-2089784350529702956?l=bumpusjournal.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This was a great book.  It clarified and explained several terms I&amp;#8217;ve run across elsewhere (discursive, cultural turn, etc) and gave an excellent grounding in some recent-ish theories and trends in history and the social sciences.  It would have been nice to have read this earlier in the semester, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Sewell is an interdisciplinary scholar who works in history as well as several of the social sciences.  As a die-hard generalist, I appreciated the breadth of his perspective and the way he connected disparate threads.  I also noted a strong tendency toward favoring Both/And over Either/Or, which I also enjoyed.  Sewell consistently provides several apparently contradictory conceptions, and then shows how they actually act together to reinforce each other.  He does this, obviously, with history and the social sciences, but also with events and theories, symbols and materiality, synchronic and diachronic analyses, language metaphors and construction metaphors, and more.  Accepting and integrating both is a great way to side-step conflict, and it gives you more tools in your toolbox as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book was written over many years as individual essays that he gathered and revised for this publication.  It&amp;#8217;s easy to see his include-it-all position through the various angles and treatments in these individual works, but it would have been nice to have a bit more of a…hmm, &amp;#8220;story arc&amp;#8221;, I guess.  I wish that chapter 10 had been more of a summary, consolidation, conclusion sort of end, instead of yet another discussion of contradictions that are actually complements.  The book just stopped, instead of concluding with a distilled statement of the whole picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the abrupt and unsatisfying end, though, this book was full of great insights and ideas to think about.  I liked the several places where Sewell suggested that one of the reasons we study history (or the social sciences) is to show why things happened then and thereby illuminate why things are happening now, to some extent or another.  I liked the contingency and agency that kept recurring, especially in light of our depressing conversations about capitalism.  He does a very good job of showing why it&amp;#8217;s not as grimly inevitable as that Latin America/Africa book made it seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, this book had so much great stuff in it, I had a harder than usual time finding the forest beyond all the interesting trees.  I guess that&amp;#8217;s part of my problem with the lack of conclusion.  Here, then, is my stab at summarizing his ten essays:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter one was an introduction of sorts, laying out his intention to combine the strengths of history and the strengths of social science.  History is good at particulars, narrative, sequential chronology, and showing the lumpiness of change over time.  The social sciences are better at big-picture generalities, theories and laws, regularities, continuities, and big scope.  They each have something to offer the other that would improve both fields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter two was cast as an autobiography, to show what social history was, how it rapidly evolved to cultural history, and what was lost in the wholesale (well, &amp;#8220;most-sale&amp;#8221;, actually) transition.  This resembled in many ways his chapter on the differences between social science and history just before.  Again, he says we need to incorporate skills and interests from both in order to give thorough descriptions of our subjects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter three considers three temporalities—teleological (long-term, progressing toward a goal), experimental (slices of time to compare equivalent and independent events), and eventful (how events are able to transform social structures).  He also discusses that time moves at three different rates—structural (centuries), conjunctual (decades), and eventful (&amp;#8220;froth on the waves&amp;#8221;)—so any good description needs to tease out different contexts and explain how they&amp;#8217;re each contributing to the situation under consideration.  He ended by sharing three examples of how the concept of enduring structures can be integrated with a history of events to show how events transform structures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter four looked more closely at these structures that social scientists are so fond of.  They include both schemas and resources, and we live in many different structures, which overlap and interact in many ways.  This multitude of structures is what allows human agency and creativity.  Chapter five continued this look at our context for living, although here he called it culture.  Culture is a collection of overlapping systems of symbols and meanings that people use and act within to live their lives.  As they live those lives, their actions may alter the symbols and meanings that enabled the actions.  Each culture encompasses many differences and has ways of organizing this variety to produce coherence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter six compared the strengths of history and anthropology, as well as how very similar they really are.  Anthropology looks at humans across space, studying the differences possible within a still-human context in order to distill what it means to be human, and historians do somewhat the same thing only across time.  Both of these fields show that a lot of what we take for granted is actually quite contingent.  He also discussed how culture and large brains developed together, because brains give us more options and culture helps us choose between them in the absence of instinct.  And he showed the slippage available between elements of culture that allow for change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter seven looked at Sahlins&amp;#8217; description of Cook&amp;#8217;s arrival in Hawaii to show how events can change social structures.  Events grow from and act within many kinds and scopes of structures, but slippage, change in resources, and human intentions can rearrange the symbols and their meanings and thereby transform the basic structures of interpretation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter eight did about the same thing for the original Bastille Day.  After an extended description of the events, he analyzed them to show how an act of violence was absorbed and interpreted to become the novel concept of an initiation of political revolution.  From this, he laid out an elaborate theory of events that incorporates structures, culture, conditions, emotions, creativity, ritual, event cascades, authoritative sanction, spatial elements, and arbitrary boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter nine began with a very long description of the dockworkers in Marseilles in order to show how some structures can persist even when surrounded by changing circumstances.  In the analysis that followed his long description, he showed how there were several temporalities and different sized structures operating, and then he explained how each one contributed to the persistence of their position, and their evolution from conservative to liberal politics.   This was an example of the combination of historical narrative and social science analysis that he&amp;#8217;s calling for throughout this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter ten tried to define &amp;#8220;social&amp;#8221;.  After an interesting etymology, he shared the language metaphor, some detractors, and how it can be stretched to answer their challenges.  Then he showed the advantages of a mechanistic/quantitative analysis for when your data are obscure, sparse, or unwieldy in narrative form, and how these strategies can show the contingency behind what had previously seemed to be &amp;#8220;blind forces&amp;#8221;.  Then he explored the social construction metaphor to show that we have more agency than we believe, and that materiality is as significant as symbology.  He finished this chapter by saying that we need to incorporate both the language metaphor and the construction one in order to adequately perceive the society and culture we&amp;#8217;re studying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then it was done.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is this blog, so Philip—whoever you are—you can unfollow me now so I no longer feel like I&amp;#8217;m being stalked.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-1983531106883465871?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;li&gt;Dan Cohen and Roy Rosenzweig, &lt;em&gt;Digital History: A Guide to Gathering, Preserving, and Presenting the Past on the Web&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antoinette Burton, &lt;em&gt;Archive Stories&lt;/em&gt;. Durham: Duke Univ. Press,&amp;nbsp;2005.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#8217;s readings were of eternal practicality to my future.  Digital history was an interesting introduction into online historical writing. Though it presented itself as a how to manual it also openly states the limitations of digital history.  The cost and time that goes into creating and maintaining a website can often shadow the actual boundaries of a department or historian.  Also the manipulability and sometimes inaccessibility, side affects of the internet, are two major factors of skepticism which I retain for digital history.  One of the positive aspects to digital history, which I admittedly use everyday, are the online databases, run often by libraries from various campuses, which facilitate the ability to do&amp;nbsp;research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning archive stories, this quote really spoke to&amp;nbsp;me,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;We would not like to end on yet another trumphalist note, because we recognize that the telling of stories, like the production of history itself, has no intrinsically redemptive power, whether revolutionary or conformist.  Stories—in whatever narrative form—embed as many secretes and distortions as archives themselves; their telling encodes selective disclosures, half-truths and partial pasts no more or less than do histories &amp;#8216;proper.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; Pg&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archive Stories caused me to rethink the infallibility of an Archive.  I, of course, understood that approaching the materials within an archive a historian should never take said documents at face value, but I failed to realize that the archives themselves are subject as well. The information they collect reflect what ever status quo their geopolitical locations&amp;nbsp;deem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work also brought to my attention  the importance, uses and limitations of oral history, such as consistency and reliability, which I then realized are the same issues historians face with written history.  Now I do not mean to understate the fact that oral history has a large grain of salt to swallow&amp;#8230; however it is one of those final frontier, as far I can tell, when Textual evidence leaves you in a&amp;nbsp;bind.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;I must admit that I was slightly nervous upon hearing of the subject of our readings this week; I did not necessarily expect bad things from these two titles, I was simply leery of the technological focus. As most people have figured out, technology is not one of my strong points and I worried my unfamiliarity with computers and whatnot might hamper my understanding of the author&amp;#8217;s arguments. I was quite relieved, therefore, to discover that I had no problem following the readings. In fact, I had a much easier time with these books than several others we have read throughout the course and found myself even enjoying them at times, something I expected from &lt;i&gt;Archival Stories &lt;/i&gt;but certainly not from &lt;i&gt;A Digital History&lt;/i&gt;. Personally, I can say that these two books have been the most practically useful texts assigned. Numerous professors and colleagues have attempted to persuade me of the advantages to be gained by a more extensive use of technology, but none have done so with as much success as &lt;i&gt;A Digital History&lt;/i&gt;. I also appreciated how &lt;i&gt;Archive Stories&lt;/i&gt; illustrated the constructed nature of historical archives, dispelling the illusion of immutable truth-holding that surrounds popular conceptions archival collections.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Somewhat unexpectedly, &lt;i&gt;A Digital History&lt;/i&gt; was my favorite of the two books assigned. I thought Cohen and Rosenaweig put admirable effort into persuading academics to partake more actively in the transition of historical document from paper to digital storage devices. The authors abstained from promoting an absolute opinion on either the usefulness of technology or its potential dangers, instead opting for a middle track that focused on how to maximize the advantages posed by technological developments while avoiding, or at least minimizing, some of the more detrimental effects. Some of the benefits the book advanced I had not previously considered, such as the manipulability of textual evidence – an idea that could entail something as simple as the ability to simultaneously compare, contrast and arrange evidence from a single location. The dangers of historical expansion onto the web are problems I am more familiar with, a result, I am sure, of the ultra-conservative beliefs espoused by my advisor as an undergraduate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;To be clear, I acknowledge and appreciate how much easier online access to thousands of historical documents has made historical research. I certainly have benefitted from this development and I am sure my dependence will only grow with time. But I also agree with one of the primary dangers Cohen and Rosenzweig point out: the internet&amp;#8217;s capacity to blur the boundary between professional and amateur work. I find the idea of amateur work functioning as historical truth inherently distasteful; although some claim historical credibility, the vast majority either regurgitate traditional interpretations or present ungrounded arguments. Because this material can be found on websites that somehow incorporate the word &amp;#8220;history&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;historical,&amp;#8221; words that apparently entail legitimacy in the eyes of the general public, &amp;#8220;true&amp;#8221; history remains in the background. On the other hand, I must admit that I am happy the general public is gaining at least some exposure to history. Since the expansion of history onto the web, public interest in the past had increased substantially and I simply cannot perceive this as a bad thing, despite the occasionally questionable nature of their information.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;I am not sure what I expected from archive stories, but what I read was certainly not it. I suppose that I imagined a book focused the stories created in archives, a view the authors directly sought to challenge by addressing instead the way in which archives themselves are created. This collection of archival stories did an excellent job at this goal, collectively illustrating the numerous ways in which personal experience and the history of archives affects the narratives that emerge. Although the idea that archives are constructed seems logical once one thinks about it deliberately, it is not a consideration that would have remained at the forefront of my thoughts when doing archival research.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;After reading this text however, similar to my mindset following our readings on objectivity, I will be much more conscious of archival flexibility. After all the complications we listed when discussion the quest for objectivity, &lt;i&gt;Archival Stories&lt;/i&gt; seemed to add yet one more layer between &amp;#8220;the truth&amp;#8221; and historical interpretation. I also agreed with the argument for the influence of current pressures upon interpretations of the past, another factor that must be considered when constructing historical narratives. The idea that individuals exist under political and social pressure is nothing new, but I had not really considered the impact of such circumstances of institutions and documentary preservation, two elements crucial in the construction and maintenance of historical archives. This book, too, is a useful guide to policing my future endeavors to accurately and successfully pursue historical research. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-6581782750857212332?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;            </content>

The archive was just the place where lovely, useful books and documents were stored.  Instead, though, our work as historians is dependent upon years of archival selection: what is kept and made available based on interest, national goals, and from reading Robertson&amp;#8217;s (somewhat whiny at times) essay, the whims of the archivists themselves.

So many websites are not reputable (although, of course, with training, they can be spotted and avoiding, just as printed popular histories can be), and then there&amp;#8217;s the question of the ephemeral nature of individual sites, discussed by Sentilles in her Archives Stories submission (I realize that one could also argue that paper is ephemeral, what with fire and the ease of shredding documents and throwing them away).  Ultimately, I see the digital world as having distinct uses, and certainly some advantages in terms of easy communication and access to documents without travel expenses, but I don&amp;#8217;t think it replaces print culture.

                                &lt;p&gt;Our readings for this week were &lt;em&gt;Archive Stories: Facts, Fictions, and the Writing of History,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Digital History, A Guide to Gathering, Preserving and Presenting the Past on the Web&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The common thread I found in the collection of essays that make up &lt;em&gt;Archive Stories&lt;/em&gt;, and the web publication of &lt;em&gt;Digital History&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; are the common issues of legitimacy that crop&amp;nbsp;up when historians use archives to perform their research.&amp;nbsp; Whether these archives are found via the internet, which holds&amp;nbsp;millions of archives,&amp;nbsp;created by&amp;nbsp;individuals and&amp;nbsp;professional organizations, or whether the archives are found in some dusty&amp;nbsp;government repository&amp;nbsp;in India or South Africa, problems&amp;nbsp;exist as to how, by whom and why&amp;nbsp;these archives were formed,&amp;nbsp;what purpose they served then, and what purpose they serve now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As John Randolph points out in&amp;nbsp;his&amp;nbsp;chapter in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Archive Stories,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;The Bakunin Family Archive,&amp;#8221; (209-232), the&amp;nbsp;essential problem is one of control.&amp;nbsp; There is very little positive control over most of the content published on the internet.&amp;nbsp; There is also a lack of permanency to it as Renee Sentilles points out&amp;nbsp;in the &amp;#8220;Archives of Cyberspace.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp; These are particular issues discussed in &lt;em&gt;Digital History&lt;/em&gt; as well.&amp;nbsp;According to the authors, one is left having to rely on the general concensus among historians on what is considered legitimate sourcing on the internet, like&amp;nbsp;Early&amp;nbsp;English Books Online,&amp;nbsp;and what is considered &amp;#8216;tertiary,&amp;#8217; like Wikipedia.&amp;nbsp; However, as &lt;em&gt;Archive Stories&lt;/em&gt; points out, there are problems of legitimacy with the traditional archive as well.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast to the internet, many archives have issues&amp;nbsp;with too much control over their content.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Barriers to archival research exist&amp;nbsp;between historians and those who have&amp;nbsp;political and cultural control over archives, such as the Bakunin Family Archive, or the Uzbekistan archives.&amp;nbsp; these&amp;nbsp;archives serve as &amp;#8220;contact points&amp;#8221; (pg28) between archivists and historians&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;often spark debate over&amp;nbsp;what versions of history may be viewed negatively by&amp;nbsp;individuals with vested interests in&amp;nbsp;maintaining, even moulding,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;ideas the archives have come to represent.&amp;nbsp; According to our authors, many archives (especially national archives) represent ethereal monuments, and to tamper with them is to invite opposition from those who do not wish to see these monuments disassembled and rebuilt into unfamiliar and/or unwanted&amp;nbsp;forms.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8880139849602883287-9000705377188802396?l=dixonro.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The readings for this week discuss the historians experience working with archives, both the materials and the institution. Archive Stories is a collection of essays that each relate one historian&amp;#8217;s experience when researching in an archive. It discusses discrimination and restricted access from archivists or government officials, gender discrimination, nationalism and national narratives, changing political regimes, the benefit of oral histories, the changing role of archives throughout history, etc. It is clear that archives are not neutral repositories of fact, but rather are organized, accessed, and preserved in necessarily limited ways. Thus our own work as historians needs to acknowledge not only the debt we owe to archival collections, but also the lens through which we work due to an archival filter before our own interpretation of the documents even begins(other than the fact that we have decided to look for them, thus bestowing some value onto them as potential sources.) The decision to keep particular documents through generations, and possibly changes in archival leadership, represents particular choices about the value of the document each time it is preserved( even if, in some cases, the author wrote &amp;#8220;to be burned&amp;#8221; in the&amp;nbsp;margin.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keepers to these collections also make choices about individual scholars and projects, as certain projects may received more support and others may be left to flounder. Some information about sources is clouded even before it comes to the archive. We like to think there is certainty about all the sources we find, but even this cannot be assured, as some documents and artifacts come to archives in mysterious ways. During my internship at the Baseball Hall of Fame, I spoke with various curators who lamented the fact that some very interesting 3D artifacts were left at the front door with no further explanation. It takes highly trained people to narrow down the historical context of a unique item, but the story of the particular artifact itself can still not be known for&amp;nbsp;sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital History: A Guide to Gathering, Preserving, and Presenting the Past on the Web, was an interesting supplement, as it continues the discussion of the role of archives and how they are formatted into the twentieth first century. Living in the information age, the possibility of (close to) a full record of events is closer than ever, and the capacity for storage of digital material is greater than would have been imagined even decades ago. However, digital records are not permanent, nor are they as unrestricted as some believe. In fact, sometimes I wonder if our quick ability to access such a broad swath of information makes us ultimately less curious about information not available on the web. Do we assume the world is really at our fingertips? I think there is some weight to both sides of the argument that the internet may be the new beginning and the end of investigative inquiry. The authors take a middle position and offer the pragmatic consideration that the internet is a tool and not the only one, which can be further sharpened and&amp;nbsp;refined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are living in a time when anyone can post on the internet(and anyone does, including this student), so the credibility of sources comes under new scrutiny. We also may now be burdened with too much information, as &amp;#8220;mastery&amp;#8221; of relevant literature may now be impossible by older standards. Still, technology continues to develop, so some drawbacks of internet searching and publishing may yet be remedied. It also provides some exciting opportunities for historical records and scholarship, as evidenced by the September 11 case study. In the wake of that tragic event, hundreds of thousands of people posted their stories on the few sites mentioned in this book alone. Millions more have recorded and shared their perceptions and remembrances of the days event online. Thus, the historians of the future will have unprecedented depth from which to draw in writing their attempts at informed description and analysis of that generation-defining event.  This is just one example; there are many others related the ability to share information around the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Burton, Archive Stories | Cohen &lt;span class=&#34;amp&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Rosenzweig, Digital&amp;nbsp;History&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#8217;s selection of essays in Burton&amp;#8217;s work really hammers home a very large point: that archives are not infallible. The archive is man-made entity and, as such, it is capable of as many faults as man. Because archives are created by imperfect men and states or other organizations, they are not perfect and the mechanisms for determining what documents are catalogued and preserved is highly political. For those with a background in public history, this is really nothing new. In the course of learning archival methodologies the door is opened for a brief glimpse into the very political world of accessioning and de-accessioning items or collections. From the historian&amp;#8217;s perspective, however, it is always helpful to remember that the archive only holds those records which were purposefully placed within—it is not the complete&amp;nbsp;record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first group of essays deals with the experiences of historians in various archives throughout the world from a first person point of view. Presented here are the many obstacles (both bureaucratic and procedural) that hampered and assisted as historians struggled to complete their researches. From this first handful of essays, it is clear that the archive is more than a repository of information: it is a living, breathing organism that is responsive to its own circumstances. The second set of essays tells the stories of the formation of various archives—from national repositories to archives in Kohler, Wisconsin that document architectural plans of sites that were never constructed. From this it is obvious that archives exist for more than one reason, as such they can provide us with more than one answer to those questions we seek to&amp;nbsp;answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final section presents the archive as current political force. The inclusion of particular items and the conscious exclusion of others represent a deliberate attempt to control the narratives of history. To be sure, none of the authors in this section are against highly critical and selective practices of accessioning items to archival collections; rather they assert that politics have too frequently been involved in the process to the detriment of certain historical traditions—particularly those of indigenous peoples and the lower classes. Oral histories are virtually nonexistent many western archives unless they are part of a specific research&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they presently exist, I think Burton would argue that archives are wholly inaccessible to most non-archivists and non-historians. Because the general public does not understand the fundamental contingency of the accessioning process, there is this belief that the archive is objective and presents the full record. Without question the archive does not present the full narrative of any line of research. Our sources are never innocent—they are products of their time and of their writer; so too are our archives. As historians we must be cognizant of these innate flaws in the archive and adjust our researches&amp;nbsp;accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without question, technology has greatly enhanced the research capabilities of modern historians; the internet connects us to various institutions and organizations to investigate their archival holdings; computers have decreased the time necessary to search a collection catalogue for particular items that may be of use; digital archives have made it unnecessary to physically visit an archive to perform research. The presence of digital and online archival resources such as the Valley of the Shadow Project (an online archive of documents pertaining to the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War) have made it possible for scholars and amateurs alike to gain first-hand knowledge of the sources that inform our&amp;nbsp;interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the extent that the authors want to make Digital History a guide book for preparing and organizing digital archives, they have succeeded. Their work is very practical and still quite applicable today. One area that I particularly liked was their discussion of copyright and fair use practices. Their very strict construction of copyright laws belies academia&amp;#8217;s adherence to the published word. The biggest problem with fair use today is the fact that it so little understood by copyright holders, users of copyrighted material, and the general&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors make a compelling case for the use of the internet as a research tool. Technology has democratized access to information and the ability to publish opinions and interpretations. To traditionalists, I think this is the biggest problem. The internet makes it much easier to spread junk history. The fair approach the authors take, however, makes it much easier to consider their argument. The internet holds great possibilities for historians, particularly as archives are digitized and made accessible via the&amp;nbsp;internet.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Rather than wax philosophical, I&amp;#8217;ll just say up front that I enjoyed these two books a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel J. Cohen and Roy Rosenzweig&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Digital History: A Guide to Gathering, Preserving, and Presenting the Past on the Web&amp;#8221; is intended as a &amp;#8220;practical handbook rather than a theoretical manifesto&amp;#8221; (p. 13). To the extent that they focus on the general ins and out, the pros and cons, of the Web as a history tool, they succeed quite well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The authors&amp;#8217; evenhanded tone does seem a bit odd as they discuss the phenomenon of &amp;#8220;grassroots historians&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; online handiwork. They seem rather indecisive regarding the level of trust that should be given Web sources. But their views on copyright law approach outright stridence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I rate this as a useful, and still timely, guide, as per the authors&amp;#8217; goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Archive Stories,&amp;#8221; meanwhile, is a treasure trove of diverse, but still widely relatable, tales pertaining to historians&amp;#8217; archiving efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standouts include:&lt;br /&gt;• Ramirez&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;A Living Archive of Desire,&amp;#8221; which highlighted the poignancy of a life that, at least at face value, is far removed from my own.&lt;br /&gt;• Sentilles&amp;#8217; &amp;#8220;Toiling in the Archives of Cyberspace,&amp;#8221; which in several ways dovetails nicely with the Cohen and Rosenzweig book.&lt;br /&gt;• Fritzsche&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;The Archive and the German Nation,&amp;#8221; a fascinating look at one nation&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;absence of a common past and the enormous violence entailed in the attempts to produce it&amp;#8221; (p. 204).&lt;br /&gt;• Pohlandt-McCormick&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Soweto in the Archives of South Africa,&amp;#8221; a terrific recounting of the writer&amp;#8217;s attempt to undo some of the damage done by a regime whose officials &amp;#8220;erased the histories of their victims and contrived to create histories that denied their culpability&amp;#8221; (p. 301). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Documents are never innocent,&amp;#8221; Pohlandt-McCormick writes (p. 316). And the same is no doubt true of the aforementioned accounts. But irrespective of their authors&amp;#8217; agendas, those works have great value, representing as they do once-lost threads now woven into history&amp;#8217;s rich tapestry.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8399157107533224051-7781309585867623374?l=bumpusjournal.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

(Yes, I&amp;#8217;m laughing) I remember when I first got a computer with a modem and internet connection.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;My phone wouldn&amp;#8217;t work while I was &amp;#8220;online&amp;#8221; and it took five minutes to get a single page, but it was from somewhere else in the world!&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The job to get email and all that was on my windows desktop – the operating system had a massive 400 megabyte hard drive and weighed about 10 pounds not counting the monitor – was called Gopher, which I think was because it was developed at the home of the Golden Gophers of Minnesota.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Now, a scant fifteen years (has it been that long?) later, we surf the internet from our phones and wonder why it takes those interminable seconds for the webpage to load.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I am happy to see that there were archivists with the foresight to commence digitizing – I think it was called scanning back then – for future generations.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;If you think about it, that was quite a smart move on their part to not only make it available but to preserve the manuscripts.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Instead of countless oily, salty, acidic fingers destroying the pages, unless gloves were used, then there is still the wear and tear on the old and brittle pages.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Untold numbers can now turn the pages with a simple mouse click.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Few need to actually examine the pages for their research, so this has greatly increased the ability of scholars to be more thorough in their work, which means more is expected of modern graduate students.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I can state from experience how much I prefer going over digitized and scanned records on my laptop as opposed to hours in front of the microfilm machine looking a government records – and I can&amp;#8217;t wait for them to digitize those rolls of microfilm to make searching the records easier.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;On virtual museums – yes, they are nice.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;However, one can look at the pieces from the world trade center in an online museum, but when you are standing in a physical museum, staring at one of the girders that have been twisted like a plastic straw; it has the power to move you on such a deeper level.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Also, I&amp;#8217;ve seen pictures of the Alamo, but when you are there, inside in the still quiet looking at the bullet pits in the walls, it brings you face-to-face with the sacrifices that were made.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve created websites since about 1998 both for myself and for church youth groups, so I&amp;#8217;ve been through much of what this book recommends.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also scanned into .pdf format several journals and books that I use in writing papers.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I did this for ease of access back in 2001 for a research paper.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Yes, I would prefer digitized, searchable format but all I had to work with then was my personal flatbed scanner and Adobe acrobat, which would group the scanned images into pages.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;We have a better version of this now in Hodges library.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;I believe though that no matter how advanced digitalization gets there is still something magical about words on dusty pages that inspires historians the world over to brave all troubles and obstacles to turn those pages.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Von Ranke is not hunched over a giant book in these.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Rather, it is the real archives that we as historians may face regardless of our specialty.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I found the information contained in this book enlightening.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It introduced ideas about how to deal with archivists we may encounter at the various repositories.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Who would have thought that simple items like melons (57) that we think little of would be the key to getting more information and access from the gatekeepers of the archives?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I can see how others would want to protect certain information from becoming public as it would force questions they did not want to ask and answers which they did not want to seek.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Many people like their version of history as it is; boiled down to a working definition of what their people believe.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Ghosh exposed the ways archivist protect their warehouse of knowledge.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It also hinted that the archivists knew the information she was after was in their charge and were very unwilling to give it up.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I am glad that, instead of destroying information they did not like, as did the Spanish with the Mayan codices, they acknowledge their historical value and tried to protect them with cajoling and condescension until they had to give up the information.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This was also what the archivists did in the Praslin case; refusing to turn over historic documents knowing they were to be destroyed.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;I love to see that oral histories are beginning to see acceptance, as in the court case in British Columbia.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;With legal precedent set, I wonder how this will affect the view many now hold on such archives.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;And what about the living archive in the Terasita la Campesina story?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I would hope that the author recorded some of the information she seemed to freely give as it would provide different perspectives on gender and sexuality that ones like Butler, Scott, and Bennett may find useful in their arguments.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;Turning now to the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; of A.; it is amazing how many hoops you have to jump through to get at information.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I understand the problems with personal information and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; theft, the need for redaction of information provided, and the need to keep that information secure.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;However, I wonder if the director decided to write his own history of the passport after he heard the author&amp;#8217;s desire to do the same.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;And having the power to prevent access to the information until his was complete, the foot-dragging began.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It makes you wonder if, in having to spell out what, when, where, and why you want/need information from the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government only leaves you open to having your ideas co-opted by the very officials in charge of helping you.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I know, conspiracy theorist love this stuff but it&amp;#8217;s still interesting.&lt;/div&gt;

Most have probably seen the &lt;i style=&#34;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&#34;&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt; Trilogy.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Remember when Gandalf told Frodo to keep the ring safe and secure, then left to consult some information?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Did anyone catch that while he was reading all those dusty books there was an archivists bringing them to him.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;How about that?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;A middle earth archive with a reading room and an archivist – nice touch of realism since some would have simply had him grabbing books off the shelf and thumbing through them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4129143196680670213-5692849682949892991?l=historical-james.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Ahhhh… familiar ground!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book, Archive Stories, presents fifteen essays around the theme of archives.  Part 1 is primarily about users&amp;#8217; experiences, Part 2 is primarily about the development of some particular archives, and Part 3 is primarily about the political ramifications of popular perceptions of archives and their objectivity.  I say primarily because most of the essays in each Part touch on the other two emphases as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall point that comes through all of these stories is that archives are not repositories of objective facts that can be used to establish a single, irrefutable truth.  In their selection, organization, accessibility, and limits, archives themselves are subjective, even before users begin to interpret their artifacts.  This inherent subjectivity needs to be explained more clearly because the evidence in archives—primarily of the written variety—is being put on a pedestal and given authority that can then be used to perpetuate unfair power relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the stories in this book, even when I wanted to argue with their interpretations.  The authors gave little snippets of their own research as context for the points they were making, so I got to visit India, Uzbekistan, New Zealand, San Francisco, the Civil War, France, Germany, Russia, Edwardian England, Wisconsin, Egypt, Soweto, British Columbia, and Australia, each with a chatty and thoughtful guide and an archive perspective.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were, however, several times I wished that the archivists could have contributed their sides of the stories.  Schadeo interpreted inadequate finding aids as deliberate attempts to exclude researchers.  Robertson was downright whiny about being denied access to people&amp;#8217;s private information.  And Milligan seemed almost to ridicule the requirements for specificity in document requests.  Each of these situations has a legitimate reason behind it—archivists (as a rule) don&amp;#8217;t hoard their collections to thwart researchers; they do the best they can within the limitations of time, space, and budget.  They also have excellent stories about the quirks of their patrons, which professional ethics require them to never share, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of archive was interpreted quite fluidly throughout.  Robertson said it was a procedure, not an institution, and gave a great etymology of the word.  Ramirez used it for the single collection of one person&amp;#8217;s oral history.  Sentilles said the internet both is an archive and contains archives.  Milligan sees them as a synecdoche of the state/citizen relationship.  Fritzsche says, &amp;#8220;Every soul possesses an archive…&amp;#8221; (184)  Mayhall shows a human body being used as an archive.  Booth presents novels as archives of an alternate view of history.  She also uses the term in ways that I couldn&amp;#8217;t figure out, as does Perry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dozens of thoughts as I read these essays (and kept track of the times they mentioned  &amp;#8220;power&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;foregrounding&amp;#8221;, and &amp;#8220;Foucault&amp;#8221;) but my biggest question is about how these collections of essays get put together into a book.  Every single essay very self-consciously refers to others in the collection, so apparently they all had each other&amp;#8217;s as they were writing.  But in responding to those others&amp;#8217;, they changed their own, so the other authors then had old versions.  This process is a lot more interactive than I&amp;#8217;d previously realized, and I wonder if that&amp;#8217;s a new thing because of the capabilities of the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to the other book:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially proud of myself for remembering the second, electronic reading for the week, but this smugness dissipated quickly when I realized it was an entire book instead of an article.  I don&amp;#8217;t like having to read from a screen, so I was regretting not having paid for a paper version.  As I got into it, though, dismay made way for growing appreciation for the advantages of an electronic format (that disturbance in the force you feel is my husband&amp;#8217;s glee at this statement—he&amp;#8217;s been dragging me, shrieking and spitting—into the 21st century for years).  I liked the footnotes that you can click on, and the expanding table of contents.  I liked that I could scroll through each section without having to wait for new pages to load, but that each section was on its own so the blue button wasn&amp;#8217;t excessively sensitive.  The lack of page numbers was a little disconcerting, though—how do you cite a quote from this?  And, for my second-ever attempt to type my reading notes, it proved to be much more wieldy than the paper book that refused to stay open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Format aside, the content and writing style were fantastic.  The authors include information that I&amp;#8217;ve wondered about for a long time, in a non-threatening and succinct way.  They note the downsides of electronic publishing as well as the benefits (like Sentilles in the other book).  They organized the information clearly and they explain it gently, as though they realize that humanities people are less likely to jump into technology than their geeky spouses.  If I ever want to go digital, this book will absolutely be my primary resource for doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly liked the section of Fair Use, which has always seemed vague and intimidating.  They did a good job of showing why it seems vague, and then provided a nice little pep talk for why we should be more courageous in using and sharing other people&amp;#8217;s work.  I&amp;#8217;d never thought about the interpretation of a law evolving in response to people&amp;#8217;s assumptions, but I can see how this is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Final Thoughts seemed to be written just for me, with comments about being deliberative and tentative and perfectionist.  By respecting my reality, they make it easier for me to consider theirs.  I never expected to enjoy a computer book, but this one—even read from a screen—was wonderful.  I&amp;#8217;m even thinking of parting with cash in order to have it in paper.  And yes, I do see the irony in that instinct.  It just seems more real (and less ephemeral, by the way) if I can hold it and scribble in the margins.  Just because I&amp;#8217;m coming to appreciate the advantages of computers doesn&amp;#8217;t mean I don&amp;#8217;t still see the advantages of paper.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-4204031510749253549?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;The collection &lt;em&gt;Archive Stories: Facts, Fictions and the Writing of History&lt;/em&gt;, edited by Antoinette Burton, is a gem of a text certain to enthrall students and historians alike, ignite the flames of interest in the lay person, and, one hopes, provoke a new generation to delve into the archives. The fifteen essays contained within take the reading on a whirlwind geographical tour, dealing with archives from Paris to Uzbekistan, British Columbia to South Africa, and cross the modern period, from archival foundations in 19th century Europe to modern court cases in late 20th century British Columbia, and everywhere in between. The wide, friendly scope of this work gives it an accessibility and sweep that do not detract from its central argument: archives are constructs and historical documents in their own write, and as such have to be treated as an object of history no less than as a historical resource.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archive Stories&lt;/em&gt; is divided into three larger units, introduced by a short essay from Burton. Burton&amp;#8217;s introduction brings to the forefront the need for archive stories, &amp;#8220;narratives about how archives are created, drawn upon, and experienced by those who use them to write history,&amp;#8221; as part of a greater program to change the perception of the archive as a static bastion of objective fact. As she points out, this is not a new concept; Jorge Canizares-Esguerra, whose work &lt;em&gt;How to Write the History of the New World&lt;/em&gt; is repeatedly mentioned throughout the essays in the book, does a superb job demonstrating the multifaceted process that goes into constructing an archive, both in the political sphere and the historical one. After briefly describing the coming essays, Burton ends her introduction with a reminder of the need for a &amp;#8220;de-bunking&amp;#8221; of the notion that the archive encapsulates the means to determine Truth; a problem made clear as &amp;#8220;the fetish of the archive as a surveillance apparatus has been matched in recent years by the fantasy that history is or can be a delivery system for absolute truth.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first section, entitled &amp;#8220;Close Encounters: The Archive as Contact Zone,&amp;#8221; could just have easily been named &amp;#8220;Stories in Archives,&amp;#8221; as the section deals with the personal experience of six historians in various archives across the world. This is by far the most fun section of the book, as professional historians give details of their interactions with archives themselves, the archivists, foreign cultures and bureaucracies, idiosyncrasies in protocol, and myriad other obstacles, aids, and adventures in their endeavors. The overarching narrative of these six works is that archives are clearly not storehouses for objective fact, but living entities that change and mutate due to sociopolitical circumstances of the nation around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first essay in the text, Durba Ghosh&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;National Narratives and the Politics of Miscegenation: Britain and India,&amp;#8221; does an exemplary job of pointing out the politics of archival work. Ghosh experienced two extremely different responses to her work on miscegenation between British colonial men and Indian women, and the responses form a backdrop to a larger challenge of archive work. In Britain, her project was well-received, with librarians, archivists, and scholars leaping to tell her their own connections to the project; they used their personal experiences of family members marrying Indian women as a marker of a greater cosmopolitan identity. This willingness on the part of the people was met, however, with silence from the archives, which had deliberately left out records of the native women. In India, the position was even worse, with &amp;#8220;many archivists and librarians den[ying] that native women became sexually involved with European men,&amp;#8221; and further absences in the archives. Ghosh ended up having to work from tangential evidence, and even novels, in order to garner evidence of something that was known and acknowledged to have happened. Archives, through their absences as much as their collections, shape history in ways that are defined by social, cultural and political motivations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other five essays reinforce this point. Jeff Sahadeo&amp;#8217;s essay &amp;#8220;Without the Past there is no Future: Archives, History, and Authority in Uzbekistan,&amp;#8221; looks at the archives from a political context, where repressive regimes in Uzbekistan have used the archival materials, and denial to them, as a means of political control and creation of legitimacy. In the process, he also takes a look at the very different living and working conditions faced by non-Western archivists and scholars in countries where history is a weapon used by the state, and where the economy cannot support historians in the manner customary in the West. Craig Robertson&amp;#8217;s and Tony Ballantine&amp;#8217;s essays continue on this trend, looking at exclusion from the archives, personal politics, and disused sources. These essays give useful tips for how to deal with archival work on a political level, but also on the neglect of certain sources from an academic standpoint, and how this can affect their future use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two essays in the first section, while still dealing with the research of individual scholars, look beyond the traditional vision of the archive to delve into oral history and cyberspace. Horacio N. Roque Ramirez&amp;#8217;s essay &amp;#8220;A Living Archive of Desire: Teresita la Campesina and the Embodiment of Queer Latino Community Histories,&amp;#8221; is not as effective of a work as many of the others, dealing with oral history archives in the form of one woman&amp;#8217;s life story, memories, and personal narrative. The main idea, of oral history being like an archive, and one that can and should be read as such, is perfectly valid, but by only using a single person as an archive, it is not as powerful as marker of the use of oral archives as Adele Perry&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;The Colonial Archive on Trial: Possession, Dispossession, and History in &lt;em&gt;Delgamuukw v. British Columbia&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;#8221; in the third section of the book. Perry&amp;#8217;s text also looks at oral history archives, but looks at a much larger scale, and in more depth the system of organization, remembrance, and use in a cultural context. Ramirez&amp;#8217;s essay is still an interesting look into Latino queer culture, and this particular personage&amp;#8217;s narrative, but as an exploration into oral archives, it falls a little flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final essay, Renee Sentilles&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Toiling in the Archives of Cyberspace,&amp;#8221; is an especially useful piece, looking at the internet as an archive and how that reshapes traditional notions of scholarship. Perhaps the most useful question she raises is the idea of permanence when it comes to Internet sources; in her own research, talking about some four hundred websites which disappeared in a single year, she writes &amp;#8220;I cannot find them; it is as if they never existed, yet I documented them in an earlier essay. Given traditional reasons for why we note source material (the reader must always be able to go back and review the information source), was my previous Internet research valid?&amp;#8221; This essay is one of the most useful and thought-provoking in the book, pointing out both the need to use the Internet, its potential applications, and its incredible expansion of scholarship (both good and bad), as well as the ways in which it will transform current modes of citation and archival thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second section of the book, titled &amp;#8220;States of the Art: &amp;#8216;Official&amp;#8217; Archives and Counter-Histories,&amp;#8221; is easily thought of as &amp;#8220;Stories of Archives.&amp;#8221; The six essays in this section look at archives and their history/construction, rather than taking the view of an individual researcher and their archival experience. The first two, Jennifer Milligan&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;What is an Archive?&amp;#8217; in the History of Modern France&amp;#8221; and Peter Fritzsche&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;The Archive and the Case of the German Nation,&amp;#8221; look at the construction of national archives in France and Germany and the political implications of both their construction and usage. These are fairly standard pieces, useful and informative, but hardly groundbreaking&amp;#8212;national archives exist for specific reasons, and tell specific narratives about the nation and their creators. The third essay, John Randolph&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;On the Biography of the Bakunin Family Archive,&amp;#8221; follows a similar vein, though it is innovative enough in its idea of taking the genre of biography to the archive as a means of constructing identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second part of this section steps outside of these more traditional ways of examining archives to look at archives outside the usual spectrum. Laura Mayhall&amp;#8217;s essay &amp;#8220;Creating the &amp;#8216;Suffragette Spirit&amp;#8217;: British Feminism and the Historical Imagination&amp;#8221; examines how archives can create a fiction where one particular facet of society, a movement, a life, whatever is emphasized to the point of being the sole reality available in the archive, a cautionary tale to researchers not to assume archives represent the full truth. Kathryn Oberdeck&amp;#8217;s essay, &amp;#8220;Archives of the Unbuilt Environment: Documents and Discourses of Imagined Space in Twentieth-Century Kohler, Wisconsin,&amp;#8221; goes even further to examine the archives of a city that only partially exists, looking at architectural designs and urban plans that never came into fruition. This essay was, in my mind, possibly the most useful in the entire book&amp;#8212;the archives of Kohler are filled with documents concerning places that never existed off paper; documents do not necessarily correlate with material reality, and the objectivist notions attached to archives in the popular mind are therefore even more dangerous than sometimes imagined. Marilyn Booth&amp;#8217;s essay, the final one in this section, examines the archive of fiction writing and how it can relate to history. On the heels of Oberdeck&amp;#8217;s work, it helps to show the point that material reality is not the sole judge of the use of an archive&amp;#8212;the never-realized plans, the fiction novels of a Lebanese feminist, both tell a great deal about the world they were constructed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final section of the book, &amp;#8220;Archive Matters: The Past in the Present,&amp;#8221; is really a series of &amp;#8220;Stories by Archives.&amp;#8221; The three essays at the end examine the effect archives have upon the present, mostly in the political arena. Helena Pohlandt-McCormick focuses on South African archives of the Soweto Uprising, Adele Perry on the &lt;em&gt;Delgamuukw v. British Columbia&lt;/em&gt; legal case, and Ann Curthoys on the eradication of the Tasmanian Aborigines, but all three are merely looking at facets of the greater problem of what archives say to the present day. Pohlandt-McCormick shows the systematic obfuscation of the truth in apartheid South African archives, the selective inclusion of sources in order to render a particular verdict to future generations, as well as the deliberate destruction of files deemed incriminating. Perry looks at how Western scholars privilege the written archive, ignoring the oral archives of the First Nations to the detriment of those of non-European descent, something explored thoroughly in Canizares-Esguerra&amp;#8217;s book which she references. Curthoys look at the historiographical debate over the fate of the Tasmanians, and how various readings of the archives from particular political agendas can give widely different views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The importance of this final section ties the entire book together. The first two sections raise important questions about the nature of archives, their use, their origins, etc., but it is only in the third section, where the flaws of common understandings of archives are displayed in a very real, very political sphere, that the scope of this book becomes clear. Burton has created a collection that urges a redefining of the archive, not only on the level of what constitutes an archive, but in the thought-process behind archival work. Archives can no longer be considered repositories of facts, but need to be seen for the constructs they are, historical artifacts in their own right to be interpreted by historians. Only when this has occurred can they be properly used, not just by historians, but by politicians and the public.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-8853144007787274275?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;thoughts on The Sexual&amp;nbsp;Contract&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it enlightening to be informed on contract theory, as a whole.  The victory that social contract theory had over Patriarchy was only due to a rigid, literalist interpretation of Patriarchy, that which views all of the arrangements in a civil society around the Father, however they failed to view what Pateman calls the Sexual contract, the contract between a man and a woman within a society, that still guarantees the man dominance over the woman, another&amp;nbsp;Patriarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Pateman the Social contract excludes women and creates a men only society. When she examined the economic opportunities for women, the glass ceiling is keeping women out of the capitalist system, even when women attain entrance into the capitalist system, they never achieve the status of capitalist, only as wage laborers or wage slaves in positions deemed&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;feminine&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She compared the slave contract and sexual contract and argued for their horrendous similarity in their one-sidedness, and here is where I take issue with her.  The slave contract has a violence factor that the sexual contract does not have.  I feel like her comparison is deeply exaggerated.  She argued for their similarities in law… but the truth is that a slave had a vastly different experience than that of a wife.  The slave was subject to oppression in ways that the wife could not&amp;nbsp;claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thoughts on Gender&amp;nbsp;Trouble&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The task of this inquiry is to center on—and decenter—such defining institutions: phallogocentrism and compulsory heterosexuality.&amp;#8221;  (Pg xxix)  What Butler is referring to here is not only questioning the centralization of feminist study on the woman, but more specifically the sexual orientation and its assumption of heterosexuality within the school of Feminism.  Butler is bringing into light queer theory.  I found this more enlightening than something to argue against, it brings to light the failure of&amp;nbsp;assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Carol Pateman, in&lt;em&gt; The Sexual Contract&lt;/em&gt;, tries to argue that women are largely ignored in the idea of  the social contract, noting that despite its inherent emphasis on free will, it still has served to uphold a patriarchal society. Here, to me, is an example of a book that is far more interesting than it&amp;#8217;s own thesis. Her reviews and discussion of the interaction between Patriarchy, paternalism, and the nature of the social contract are really well done and engaging; however,she manages&amp;#8211;and perhaps this is simply a function of her writing style, because logically she makes the connection&amp;#8211; to muddle these together almost at random, interjecting contract theory into discussions of other phenomena causing it to seem like she has to strain to make the connections between the various thoughts and her thesis. She also is forced to say some rediculus things: arguing, for example, that if someone looks for patriarchy they will find it (the last paragraph of the second chapter). However, her thesis is clear and i think generally proven here. She also handles a lot of thinkers from different eras deftly and is able to glean out what she finds useful and more often than not argue away what&amp;nbsp;isn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of reading this book was context;  I was not sure how revolutionary many of her arguments are simply because I don&amp;#8217;t know, for example, to what extent the marriage function of the term &amp;#8220;patriarchy&amp;#8221; had been lost prior to her writing it. I have a hunch my impression of some of the terms she attempts to define are impression formed after her period; many of her writings, then, loose their initial implication and now seem to be arguments against&amp;nbsp;phantoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do hope that  my reviews of this book are not seemed too negative; I did enjoy it and though it was an interesting and well developed take. I am just not sure either where it fits in to feminist theory or just how connected all of these critical approaches are to one another and weather or not contract theory is ocean to which all the rivers flow. The negative, than, is precisely that: a reflection of my&amp;nbsp;ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;As I began the preface, I realized this would probably be a confusing book for me.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Philosophical works are barely on the main deck, let alone in my wheelhouse.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;With that said, here goes.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Upon reading the 1990 preface, I came to only one conclusion; she may have been using English, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t any English I understood. &amp;#8220;As a strategy to denaturalize and resignify bodily categories, I describe and propose a set of parodic practices based in a performative theory of gender acts that disrupt the categories of the body, sex, gender, and sexuality and occasion their subversive resignification and proliferation beyond the binary frame.&amp;#8221; I have no idea what this means.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Maybe if I read it a few more times it will start to make sense.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;Her 1999 preface made more sense; at least I understood it better.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Maybe that is why she wrote it.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;She said the book was rooted in &amp;#8220;French Theory&amp;#8221; with some feminist theory thrown in for good measure, so I was prepared for another round of the man-haters club.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;However, she was on a separate course.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;She wants her lifestyle choices to be accepted by all. (xix) This sounds a little hedonistic to me, but it would seem she had a rough go of it early and that made her a little mad at the world and this was her venting session.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I can understand that.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;As she begins, we learn that &amp;#8220;woman&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;gender&amp;#8221; are political constructs that limit what a person actually is.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;She says the definition of &amp;#8216;women&amp;#8217; has been harder to redefine that &amp;#8216;patriarchy&amp;#8217;. (7)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;She asserts that &amp;#8220;gender is culturally constructed: hence, gender is neither the causal result of sex nor as seemingly fixed as sex.&amp;#8221; (9-10) She speaks about Monique Wittig and the desire to use &amp;#8220;person&amp;#8221; to remove gender and the baggage that comes with it.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This would seem a good idea.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Think about it, does the phrase, &amp;#8220;That is one happy kid,&amp;#8221; seem more open to interpretation than, &amp;#8220;That is one happy boy?&amp;#8221;&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;By using a tag, boy/girl, the connotation of the statement is altered.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;As Butler is talking about Douglas&amp;#8217; ideas about how bodies are inscribed by our culture to designate them male and female, it got me to thinking about how they are inscribed. I was expecting thoughts on tattoos, piercings, head shavings, and the like.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I found none of that.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;However, I would have thought she would have pulled tattoos into the mix.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Wasn&amp;#8217;t this a common male custom, especially sailors?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Now, I&amp;#8217;ve seen women with tattoos on their chest at Belk in Knoxville – it&amp;#8217;s a little weird.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It would seem this would fall under gender questioning wouldn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;To address the elephant… it&amp;#8217;s weird because I&amp;#8217;m a little old fashioned.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Discreet tattoos on females may be okay.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Unless you&amp;#8217;re a sailor or a member of a tribe, that really cool tattoo is going to look funny when you&amp;#8217;re 75.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;A few piercings may be cool, but if refrigerator magnets stick to your face, or anywhere else, that may be a bit too much.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;In the words of Chief Ten Bears, &amp;#8220;That is all I have to say.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Were male-female relations still in a comparatively primitive state 22 years ago? Was Carole Pateman then entirely too inclined to see everywhere the legacy of an unenlightened past? Or am I now too naïve to see pervasiveness thereof?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &amp;#8220;The Sexual Contract&amp;#8221; (1988), Pateman does an excellent job critiquing contract theory – in particular many of its inherent inequities and contradictions. Particularly fascinating are her citations of the tortured logic that was used to justify slavery and women&amp;#8217;s exclusion from society&amp;#8217;s functionings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, from a social standpoint, her position is eminently sensible. It&amp;#8217;s a well-reasoned explanation for what I understand or have seen firsthand of gender relations among those of pre-baby boom generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet …&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the risk sounding like an apologist and/or a simpleton who feels we&amp;#8217;ve attained the best of all possible worlds (no need to elaborate on the myriad well-known ways we still fall short), I – a 40-year-old male – don&amp;#8217;t believe present-day situation is quite as bleak as the one Pateman outlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dynamics between men and women at large probably are in some ways apt to bear vestiges of the old, exclusively male-authored contract. But among married couples my own age, for example, I see very little that resembles the unilateral subordination that Pateman depicts; nor do I see even an expectation thereof. (I should add, I&amp;#8217;m not qualified to comment on any evolution of attitudes toward prostitution.) So there&amp;#8217;s that, for whatever it&amp;#8217;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Judith Butler&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Gender Trouble&amp;#8221; (1989), I found particularly intriguing her assertion that &amp;#8220;only the feminine gender is marked … the universal person and the masculine gender are conflated, thereby defining women in terms of their sex and extolling men as the bearers of a body-transcendent universal personhood.&amp;#8221; (pp. 13-14)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a sentiment is cause to ponder the English language&amp;#8217;s annoying (but supposedly innocuous) lack of gender-neutral pronouns – an absence that traditionally has rendered male pronouns the default setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, specific to our university, there&amp;#8217;s the practice of referring to our women&amp;#8217;s athletic teams as the Lady Vols (as distinct from the male just-plain Vols). How might that be explained, and is it a sign of progress that such nomenclature is now rather quaint?&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8399157107533224051-1981948835959519652?l=bumpusjournal.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The Sexual Contract by Carole Pateman examines the historical subjugation of women as a necessary part of social contract history. She argues that patriarchy was not overthrown by the shift to representative government, but rather that it has taken on a new modern form. Pateman argues that despite some problems inherent in the term &amp;#8220;patriarchy,&amp;#8221; it still best describes the multifaceted social control that males have over females.  She evaluates many contract theorists and argues that their perceptions of women are crucial for fully understanding their contract theories. Women are conspicuously absent in many historical accounts of social contract theory, but Pateman makes clear that they are not ignored by the traditional theorists, nor are they treated neutrally. With the exception of Hobbes, all traditional theorists believe women to be innately inferior to men, and as such are not fit for citizenship. Women cannot be &amp;#8220;individuals&amp;#8221; in the same way as men. Pateman cleverly points out the contradiction in this argument, however, as women are expected to engage in marriage contracts and contracts can only be legitimized between two consenting individuals. She also makes a few interesting comparisons to slave contracts(also inherently contradictory) and marriage, in that both result in civil death and the loss of one&amp;#8217;s autonomy over one&amp;#8217;s own&amp;nbsp;body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the book seems to falter, in my mind, is the periodic victimization of the women discussed within the book. While Pateman argues at the beginning that women should not be viewed as passive victims of a corrupt system, her language obscures this fact at later points in the book. In her articulation of male sex-right over his wife, a fully legitimate example of male dominance, she seems to deny that females also have a desire to engage with their partner sexually. The marriage is not complete until it is consummated, she interprets as male sex-right, though it could just as easily be interpreted as a mutual sexual act, releasing both spouses from social restraints against premarital sex. She also omits the religious significance of the act as two bodies becoming one, a belief she seems to deride as a facade for male lust in other parts of the book, in favor of a Freudian interpretation. She does seem to forestall some of this criticism by insisting that while many couples are not oppressive, the institution itself cannot be separated from its inherent subjugation of women. Still, she seems to imply that the sexual appetite of the wife will never be satisfied to the extent of the husband, a statement that would need more evidentiary&amp;nbsp;support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, she makes the case for despotic authority more persuasively. Women are forced into marriage by societal expectations and economic restrictions and then surrender their labor power, personhood, and sexual capacities- this part of the argument is well supported. Though sometimes couched in dismal language, she remains convincing that this grim portrayal is warranted by the experience of many married women, and more importantly, by the capability of all married men to become tyrants(whether or not they would,&amp;nbsp;personally).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;This week, I was not pleasantly surprised upon completion of &lt;i&gt;The Sexual Contract. &lt;/i&gt;Fortunately, I was not disappointed either and the book managed to satisfy my somewhat higher expectations following the discussion last Monday. Although I enjoyed many of the ideas put forth in this book as well as Pateman&amp;#8217;s use of gender theory, I found some parts rather difficult to get through.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Pateman&amp;#8217;s deep familiarity with contract theory, a knowledge I do not particularly share, also hindered my attempts to fully understand her arguments.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;From the start, &lt;i&gt;The Sexual Contract&lt;/i&gt; grasped my attention.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Although I have had some exposure to the original contract, I must admit that prior to reading this book I was guilty of many of the misconceptions Pateman critiqued.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;According to Pateman, the story of the original contract has not been fully explained because a critical component of this contract, the sexual part, has been ignored. The original contract&amp;#8217;s social role has been well examined, but its role as a modern form of patriarchy remains something of a mystery.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I greatly appreciated Pateman&amp;#8217;s constriction of her patriarchal examination to a specific form of patriarchy as it emerged in the modern world. In addition, Pateman acknowledged that women&amp;#8217;s positions have varied greatly across time and geographical distances. Our discussion of Bennett&amp;#8217;s book last week left me leery of attempts to generalize gendered structures too broadly. I also enjoyed Pateman&amp;#8217;s argument that political right originates as patriarchal right. I have never considered the original contract as the means by which pre-modern patriarchal right was transmuted to political right and new form of patriarchy, but this argument was quite persuasive for me. I was, however, slightly hesitant of Pateman&amp;#8217;s suggestion that the original contract was established only as a way to subjugate the female sex. I would not deny that this motivation factored into the decision to contract, but I disagree with the extent to which she pushes this argument.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;For me, the most interesting part of &lt;i&gt;The Sexual Contract &lt;/i&gt;was the discussion of patriarchy. It was interesting to see Pateman&amp;#8217;s argument for the incorporation of patriarchy into historical study following Bennett&amp;#8217;s last week.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Pateman disagrees with the idea that patriarchy declines as a viable form of political power in the last couple of centuries. Instead, patriarchy is still a dominant influence that affects not only the household but politics and the economy as well. I must admit I was not completely enthralled by her long discussion of the theoretical confusions surrounding patriarchy, but I admit the usefulness of such a survey. &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Perhaps my favorite part of the patriarchy argument is her assertion that patriarchy is a social invention. Pateman delves briefly into biology and theories on man in the state of nature, particularly Hobbes, to establish a father&amp;#8217;s disassociation from his child. According to Pateman men have no natural right over women or children; in fact, maternal right ruled in the state of nature because it was the mother who bore the child. After inception, the father no longer played a role and had no direct link to the child. Barring a natural foundation then, the idea of patriarchy must be a human invention. The patriarchal powers of fatherhood have an entirely different social meaning than those of motherhood. Although Pateman refers frequently to the invention of patriarchy, I was disappointed not to see a discussion of how such a power construction emerged. Of course, such a task is likely too large for this book but I would enjoy a study explaining this phenomenon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Overall, the sexual contract was one of my favorite books this semester. I thoroughly enjoyed reading a more concrete application of theoretical ideas rather than a pure study of theory. I have also been surprised at the level of appreciation for women&amp;#8217;s studies the last two week&amp;#8217;s readings have instilled in me. Women&amp;#8217;s studies have never figured largely into my historical perspective, but that has already started to change as these reading have diverted my attention to the pervasiveness of such factors. Although gender studies are valuable in their own right, I find even more useful the application of such theories as a means of shedding additional light on other areas of history traditionally devoid of such considerations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-5191129051292200993?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Pateman&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Sexual Contract&amp;#8221; argues that there is an implicit, often overlooked and hidden, sexual component to the Enlightenment social contract theory.  She argues that &amp;#8220;patriarchy&amp;#8221; is often understood to involve a parental relationship; its strict male/female meaning generally neglected  As such, she seems to predate Bennett&amp;#8217;s argument from last week that &amp;#8220;patriarchy&amp;#8221; should make a comeback in discussions of gender and feminism.  In the modern era, Pateman presents a rather bleak picture of male oppression of women, arguing that although women in the Anglo countries she studies have reached a level of judicial equality, they are still secondary to men in marital relationships and in the question of prostitution.  I did notice that the studies she cites to support her arguments about the views of wage-earning married women were published in the early 1980s, with data likely gathered from the late 1970s; I questioned how dependent she should be on their findings nearly ten years later.  Her use of Freud was surprising; she acknowledges that he is not normally used in discussions of social contract theory, and I was often unclear as to whether she was applying his views about fraternity and sons displacing the fathers to the late twentieth century or not (her love of the historical present and her often sloppy use of the word &amp;#8220;contemporary&amp;#8221; didn&amp;#8217;t help).  Many psychologists now dismiss the details of Freud&amp;#8217;s theories, and so I questioned how relevant they were to Pateman&amp;#8217;s argument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butler analyzes the idea of compulsory heterosexuality in her attempts to re-examine the construction of gender and its interplay with sex.  Throughout, she points out flaws in and deconstructs previous theorists&amp;#8217; work.  I was surprised not to find a discussion of Scott&amp;#8217;s article (unless I overlooked it).  In the process of taking apart so many other theories, I somewhat lost track of what Butler was proposing.  I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; she is advocating for defining gender as a performance.  Wittig&amp;#8217;s view, discussed in the last chapter, that not only gender, but also sex, is constructed was interesting; I hadn&amp;#8217;t previously run across that viewpoint.  Butler&amp;#8217;s discussion of grammar and language was sometimes murky, but I was struck by the statement in the last chapter, regarding the French use of masculine &amp;#8220;ils&amp;#8221; as the normative, universal &amp;#8220;they.&amp;#8221;  Throughout her book, whenever she wrote about masculine as universal and feminine as particular, I kept thinking about &amp;#8220;ils&amp;#8221; and its Spanish corollary &amp;#8220;ellos.&amp;#8221;  Thus, it was good to have her give that example to confirm my reading of that portion her text.  (Interestingly, German just has one, non-gendered word for &amp;#8220;they,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;sie,&amp;#8221; which happens to also be the singular feminine subject pronoun.)&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6220711600267285330-7176255148315643303?l=jawhite21.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Our readings this week were &lt;u&gt;Gender Trouble: Feminism and Subversion of identity&lt;/u&gt;, by Judith Butler, and &lt;u&gt;The Sexual Contract&lt;/u&gt;, by Carole Pateman.&amp;nbsp; I found these two works to be&amp;nbsp;interesting; even if I didn&amp;#8217;t entirely agree with their arguments.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gender Trouble discusses what amounts, in relation to my own interests, to be a fringe topic of how different sexualities are&amp;nbsp;not given equal weight in gender discussions.&amp;nbsp; Instead, they are&amp;nbsp;often dismissed as&amp;nbsp;abnormal,&amp;nbsp;and therfore&amp;nbsp;excluded from &amp;#8216;normative&amp;#8217; constructs of&amp;nbsp;gender studies and sexuality.&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;The Sexual Contract&lt;/u&gt;, on the other hand, takes a universalist look at gender relations in which male dominated society has created a civil construct that has enslaved women through&amp;nbsp;a sexual contract&amp;nbsp;gives new form and funtion in our modern society to the old pre-enlightenment patriarchical&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pateman&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;work is a call for true gender neutrality in both the public and private sphere.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#8220;The appropriate feminist response then seems to be to work for the elimination of all reference to the difference between men and women in political life,&amp;#8221; (pg 16), and &amp;#8220;if contract is extended into the private sphere, inequalitites of status between men and women in marriage must disappear,&amp;#8221; (pg 167).&amp;nbsp; Given the bleak picture of the relationship between the sexes that Pateman paints throughout the book, this hardly seems achievable.&amp;nbsp; To me, the male seems demonized in&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;The Sexual Contract&lt;/u&gt;, and women&amp;nbsp;are portrayed as&amp;nbsp;martyrs to the system.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Even though,&amp;nbsp;in a Marxist sense, women own the means of production, and&amp;nbsp;males&amp;nbsp;want to own this process,&amp;nbsp;so one might think&amp;nbsp;women would have more&amp;nbsp;influence on the system.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;being facetious, but this raises an issue we discussed last week of the level of female complicity in the system.&amp;nbsp; Pateman portrays women&amp;nbsp;as subjugated and exploited vigorously by the male.&amp;nbsp; I don&amp;#8217;t know; it all seems very general&amp;nbsp;to me.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Pateman fails to&amp;nbsp;interpret the nuances of familial cooperation that exist between man and wife in the &amp;#8216;sexual contract.&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Even as I fully realize the legal constructs of our society&amp;nbsp;have been male dominated hsitorically, there are obviously redeeming qualities to this relationship that allowed it to survive as long as it has.&amp;nbsp; So, although I&amp;nbsp;didn&amp;#8217;t completely disagree with her arguments,&amp;nbsp;I must say some of them&amp;nbsp;definitely raised an eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;u&gt;Gender Trouble&lt;/u&gt;,&amp;nbsp;Judith Butler explains that &amp;#8220;I opposed what I took to be heterosexualism at the core of sexual&amp;nbsp;difference fundamentalism,&amp;#8221; (1999 preface, pg viii).&amp;nbsp; Butler argues that a focus on normative sexuality as opposed to lesbianism and homosexuality&amp;nbsp;leads to skewed analyses of gender.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I agree that the male female dichotomy&amp;nbsp;alone in a heterosexual milieu narrows the focus of gender studies, I&amp;#8217;m not sure the inclusion of all sexual preferences&amp;nbsp;would add clarity to the major arguments of&amp;nbsp;gender studies such as the issues with which Pateman wrestles.&amp;nbsp; However,&amp;nbsp;I do think&amp;nbsp;Butler is wise to point to the need to exercise&amp;nbsp;caution in gender related analyses by&amp;nbsp;understanding that the general context in which one is conducting&amp;nbsp;one&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;studies may not be entirely representative.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8880139849602883287-702205023892921842?l=dixonro.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Butler, &lt;em&gt;Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity&lt;/em&gt; | Pateman, &lt;em&gt;The Sexual&amp;nbsp;Contract&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butler&amp;#8217;s argument was somewhat convoluted (possibly made more so by the fact that I did not have the text in my hands) and I am sure that there are many important nuances that I did not pick up on as she explained her thesis.  Such caveats notwithstanding, the main objective of her work is arguing that the manner in which feminists identify (or are forced to identify by a patriarchal system), and connect that identity to politics, is constraining because it assumes &amp;#8220;women&amp;#8221; are a single unified body based solely on sex.  In Butler&amp;#8217;s opinion, accepting such a definition of gender is a logical fallacy for feminism as a political movement.  Through a deconstructionist theory, she is able to mock the idea of a unified concept of &amp;#8220;women&amp;#8221; behind feminism.  For Butler, the concepts of sex and gender are indeterminate.  Furthermore, concepts such as male-female and masculine-feminine are political constructs and should have no bearing on how feminists, or anyone else,&amp;nbsp;identify. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender, in Butler&amp;#8217;s mind is little more than performance, and people in general, and feminists in particular should be aware of how they perform  their socially constructed roles in order to effect change.  Advancing an argument for a more fluid definition of gender rooted in self-identification and sexuality makes it easier to subvert the male-dominated culture.  Marginalized segments of society can also use fluid definitions of gender rooted in sexuality to work against the established culture.  Essentially, because women, lesbians, and gays are less engaged in the traditional male-dominated culture, they have more freedom to subvert or denaturalize the established categories of&amp;nbsp;gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butler&amp;#8217;s argument is based on a definition of gender that is a political construct.  Pateman offers an exploration of just how that came to be through a reexamination of social contract theory.  Behind the rhetoric of liberty and equality espoused by proponents of the social contract, Pateman argues there is a larger unifying force of fraternity that, while eliminated inequality among men, has increased inequality between the sexes.   &amp;#8221;Sex&amp;#8221; she argues &amp;#8220;is central to the original contract,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;civil freedom includes right of sexual access to women and, more broadly, the enjoyment of mastery as a sex—not a gender&amp;#8221; (225).  Through extrapolations of the social contract via the marriage contract and the prostitution contract women are &amp;#8220;tainted with the odour [sic] of slavery&amp;#8221; (230) and subjugation by&amp;nbsp;men. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pateman concedes that movement for equality between the sexes has made some great advances in the last century, that women now enjoy judicial equality and the a certain equality of opportunity with men.  However, sexual harassment has been &amp;#8220;discovered in the workplace and the patriarchal division of labour [sic] has not been greatly upset &amp;#8230; and that women&amp;#8217;s economic circumstances still place them at a disadvantage in terminating the marriage contract&amp;#8221; and the act of sex has been encapsulated by a growing sex industry &amp;#8220;which provides men with new forms of access to women&amp;#8217;s bodies&amp;#8221; (228).   In essence, she argues that advances have been made and they have been easily worked around because the social contract was always predicated on the subjugation of women by&amp;nbsp;men.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Due to my apparent habit (once is an accident, twice is a habit) of forgetting the accompanying article until alerted by my colleagues&amp;#8217; blogs, I decided to begin with the Butler excerpts.  Also, after that enticing disclaimer in class, I hoped that Pateman would be like dessert in comparison.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Butler&amp;#8217;s language didn&amp;#8217;t turn out to be as bad as I&amp;#8217;d expected, despite having to read from a screen, but her content was disappointing.  Well, uneven, I guess.  There were parts that I found interesting, and even a few things I enjoyed, but overall, I just wanted to shriek, So &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WHAT&lt;/span&gt;!!!  I&amp;#8217;m not sure if I&amp;#8217;m fed up with theory in general or the persecution complex and contentious perspective of the last few readings, but I know I&amp;#8217;ve had it with reading page after page of verbose, self-aggrandizing vocabulary manipulations that just over-inflate small ideas to make them seem more significant.  Seriously, if you can&amp;#8217;t say it succinctly, you don&amp;#8217;t understand it well enough.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, rant aside, here&amp;#8217;s what I took away, beginning with my favorite quote of the whole book:  &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;trouble is inevitable and the task, how best to make it, what best way to be in it.&amp;#8221;  With a start like that, I figured this would be great.  Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She presented several ideas, over and over, among them:&lt;br /&gt;1) Gender is a performance—something we do, not something we are—and so doesn&amp;#8217;t need to be limited to two choices.  She mentioned her uncle as being institutionalized just because he didn&amp;#8217;t fit into one of those slots.&lt;br /&gt;2) Language supports the naturalizing of gender and sex.  The word &amp;#8220;women&amp;#8221; is inadequate both because it&amp;#8217;s only one aspect of a person and because it&amp;#8217;s expected to refer to such a variety of people that is ceases to have meaning (sort of like our complaint of &amp;#8220;lesbian-like&amp;#8221; last week).  I also liked her crack that pronouns become a problem here, on…some page that I can&amp;#8217;t find now!&lt;br /&gt;3) Since gender is a construct, it is a cause of our perception of sexual differentiation instead of being a result of any inherent differences.  Here she pulled in Foucault&amp;#8217;s idea around how prohibiting delinquency in effect created the category of delinquency.  This has some merit, I suppose, in an ivory-tower theoretical sort of way, but I&amp;#8217;ve changed enough diapers to say that you don&amp;#8217;t need a pink ribbon glued to a bald head to see what you&amp;#8217;re dealing with once the tape comes off.  Maybe this is more effort to make Middlesex people ordinary instead of exceptional.  I did like her explanation of Foucault in the 1990 preface, though I didn&amp;#8217;t understand why he called this a genealogy. &amp;#8220;…genealogy investigates the political stakes in designating as an origin and cause those identity categories that are in fact the effects of institutions, practice, discourses with multiple and diffuse points of origin…&amp;#8221; (xxix)&lt;br /&gt;4) Finally! The drag section didn&amp;#8217;t come until the last part of the last chapter.  It provided a glimmer of concreteness to what she&amp;#8217;d been talking around through all those previous pages.  Drag shows that surface indications aren&amp;#8217;t true, which extends the thought to body elements.  Just as &amp;#8220;female&amp;#8221; clothes cover a &amp;#8220;male&amp;#8221; body, so does a &amp;#8220;male&amp;#8221; body cover a &amp;#8220;female&amp;#8221; self.  Drag is simultaneously anatomy, identity, and performance, each out of expected alignment, which thereby shows all three to be contingent.  The parody of drag provides freedom from the hegemony of the binary cultural expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, to Pateman, supposedly my dessert.  She was easier to read, but she&amp;#8217;s still contentious and verbose, using too many words and too many disparate sources to supposedly prove her point.  She claims that contract theory obscures reality because it ignores the sexual contract that undergirds and predates it.  She sees contracts as creating domination instead of limiting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if she&amp;#8217;s finding what she&amp;#8217;s looking for, even though it&amp;#8217;s no longer (if ever) true.  She wrote 22 years ago, but even then, women weren&amp;#8217;t relegated to the private sphere because they were considered less rational than men.  If anything, women were considered inadequate by other women when they chose the private sphere.  The women&amp;#8217;s movement, in demanding equal access to one style of life, has inadvertently (I hope) suggested that other styles are a betrayal.  In any case, society has come a long way from the vision she argues against.  I wonder—given my abhorrence for confrontation—how much of the progress has come from radical exaggerations and theoretical flights, and how much has resulted from a more incremental, persistent &amp;#8220;add women and stir&amp;#8221; approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading these two books suggested to me where our leeriness about feminist theory may be coming from.  Both of these were very political, abstract, and strident.  They include a lot of extreme ideas ungrounded in specific, concrete examples.  They deal with society on a mega-level, calling for massive changes to all of reality, instead of focusing on a manageable sphere of influence where something might actually happen.  Fundamentally, despite Pateman&amp;#8217;s lead sentence on page one, there aren&amp;#8217;t enough stories.  I want a pictures from which to hang all her big ideas.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this is a theory class, but I&amp;#8217;m beginning to feel like the cartoon guy crawling across the desert:  Must…Find…Narrative…&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-7360964156996088641?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 46.5pt;&#34;&gt;I am going to hit a few high points in the book that stood out to me…&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;Carol Pateman sets out in her book, &lt;i style=&#34;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&#34;&gt;The Sexual Contract&lt;/i&gt; to draw attention to the notion that the famous &amp;#8220;social contract,&amp;#8221; which even the framers of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights had in mind as they created the American trinity of liberty (my words not hers), had a little-acknowledged rider to it; the sexual contract.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;She states it better as the male sex-right, and that even though the &amp;#8220;social contract is a story of freedom; the sexual contract is a story of subjection.&amp;#8221; (2) The social contract masks the fact that it was instituted by men, between men, and for men. This is achieved by dividing society into two spheres – civil and private.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;By pushing the women completely into the private sphere, men can dominate the civil sphere, and thus dominate society.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It is further hidden by paternalism, which subsumes the female under the protection of the male, who takes the role as the head of household.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This hides the argument further by using the father to exemplify the state, with the family as its citizens dutifully following – including mom.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;In chapter 3 she lays out the basic contract theory: we are individuals born free and equal. (39)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;We then choose to be under the authority of the state.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I seem to recall when a group of &amp;#8216;states&amp;#8217; didn&amp;#8217;t want to be under the authority of the &amp;#8220;State&amp;#8221; there was a little war.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;In 1865, after this little war, the &amp;#8220;State&amp;#8221; acted like a punishing father spanking his children for disobeying his orders.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Though she didn&amp;#8217;t use that analogy to disrupt the theory it does sound good to me.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;However, onward we go.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Conjugal power would seem a different way of saying sexual power, but Locke uses conjugal as a natural power men have over women from nature. (51)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Pufendorf follows up with the idea that men have this power to get women to consent to subjection, and this is due to male physical strength being greater than a female&amp;#8217;s.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I guess he was closer to the days when clubbing meant whacking a female with a stick and dragging her back to the cave.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Yes, I&amp;#8217;m laughing right now at that. I know. &lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a dork, but that is pretty close to the idea &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;I want to finish this blog with one final thought.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Pateman wrote this stuff in 1988 – 22 years ago.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;In her last two chapters she covers ideas about prostitution, sado-masochism, fetishes, and wonders what&amp;#8217;s next.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I wonder if she has any new views about the state of female subjection and patriarchy.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I would like to think we&amp;#8217;ve made strides toward evening the divide.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;There can be no doubt there will always be a difference between men and women, but sometimes those differences complement each other.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I remember a wedding service I heard once.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The preacher made the statement that when God made Eve he used one of Adams ribs.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;He didn&amp;#8217;t use a bone from his feet so that she was under him or one from his head so she was over him, but from his side as she was to be beside him and work with him.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;And what he couldn&amp;#8217;t do, she could and vice versa.&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Carole Pateman&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Sexual Contract&lt;/em&gt; operates on the premise that current social-contract theory misses a vital point, that the contract is not simply a political one but a sexual one. The political right invoked in the social contract is, in her opinion, also a patriarchal right or sex-right, giving men power over women. She argues that the creation of social contract-based civil society is also a new patriarchal society. This is innovative, in her argument, because traditionally patriarchy has been defined as the power of the father, not the power of the husband over the wife or man over woman; writing at the end of the 80&amp;#8217;s, I will buy this theory, at least thus far—it&amp;#8217;s still early enough that, perhaps, feminist arguments about the patriarchy have not breached into the mainstream, or at least not into contract theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The connection between the marriage contract and the social contract, which she lays out at the beginning (it&amp;#8217;s nice of her to clearly state the purpose of her book and its framework right off the bat, at least), is an interesting one, and, to be frank, the part of this book that I found both most intellectually stimulating and most relevant to her topic. The idea of the marriage contract both being perpetuating the dominance of the woman by the man in the modern era, and its connection to civil society via the social contract, was not something I&amp;#8217;d ever considered, even though I had thought long and hard about the implications of marriage in my younger, commitment-phobic days. I certainly don&amp;#8217;t believe that the link between the marriage contract and the slave contract, or even the patriarchal dominance of women, is necessarily true in the West today (and she&amp;#8217;s only interested in the Anglophone West, so I feel qualified to make such judgments), but as a historical topic it was… illuminating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have to say I&amp;#8217;ve never met anyone who claimed that the advent of &amp;#8220;civil society&amp;#8221; and the modern era led to an end of the patriarchy or the domination of women by men, if these were topics they discussed at all. I am not necessarily familiar with the debates over the term patriarchy, or feminist theory or history, but… and her insistence on the negative aspects of the marriage contract, that it is in essence a tool of oppression solely, regardless of how men and women attempt to break out of it… well, let&amp;#8217;s just say I entered the second chapter of the book a bit leery of what I would find. Intrigued, and at least attempting to maintain a positive attitude, but leery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second chapter was a very useful overview of the term &amp;#8220;patriarchy&amp;#8221; and its use for her purposes. I also noticed that the sensation of being screamed at, or at least severely berated, ceased in this chapter. I was familiar with a paternalism version of patriarchy and its relationship to the state, but again, patriarchy in a feminist context is one I am familiar with in only the most general terms. Linking the two forms of patriarchy, and how they interact with society, was a helpful refresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter three returns to marriage, and I have to admit, personal bias gets in my way of appreciating her point, because I find her arguments about marriage narrow-minded. In theory, marriage in the modern day is between equals—arguments about rings denoting ownership are nonsense, the marriage contract in the modern era in an equal undertaking, and in the Anglophone world nowadays you don&amp;#8217;t even need cause for divorce, so it&amp;#8217;s surprisingly easy for both men and women to get out of it. Alimony, child support, etc. in general mean that men (overwhelmingly the higher earners still, though that&amp;#8217;s another discussion) continue to help women out after a divorce. Even historically, most marriage contracts have provided women with some rights, however limited, and even sexually women were supposed to have the right to their husbands body during the middle ages. Of course, I&amp;#8217;m not arguing that marriage is not historically a mostly repressive regime of men dominating women physically, sexually, emotionally, politically, economically, etc., because it was and in some parts of the world still is. But in the Anglophone world, which is her specific focus, she continues to discuss marriage as if it were still this way, and it&amp;#8217;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there&amp;#8217;s my little rant, and I won&amp;#8217;t mention it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once she gets back to the nature of contract theory, I perked back up. The link between slavery as a contract and social contracts in general was interesting, and I think fits in very well with our discussions of the capitalist &amp;#8220;world&amp;#8221; system and the wage slave (as she mentions), but I was left somewhat confused as to how the slave contract and the sexual contract really interrelate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fourth chapter, and the parts dealing with the fraternity aspect of the patriarchy, and the father-right, and the religious aspects thereof were all interesting. The links between Locke&amp;#8217;s vision of the father-ruler and the patriarchal basis of rulership were pretty clear, as well as the way his vision of the social contract could lead to a directly patriarchal civil society. This section, discussing solely the original social contract theorists and their vision of a patriarchal society, makes perfect sense, even the inclusion of marriage into the debate. I can very clearly see her point, that this vision of civil society completely excludes women from the social contract and therefore from the civil society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to mention my thoughts on how she ended the chapter, or the last paragraph of chapter four. At all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning of chapter five she does finally mention that the world of the classic contract is essentially different in many ways from our modern social world. I wish she had presented that understanding all along, and at least mentioned at the beginning that her concepts of some things were based on more classical notions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She kept discussing how wives are like servants—does she not mention women in the workforce at all? Right, end of the 80s. Man, I would love to read an updated version of this for 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The model of economic coercion and essentially work-whoring is not a crazy one—actually, it made a lot of sense. The economic aspects of marriage are pretty clear, supportive of her argument, etc. I think we&amp;#8217;ve talked sufficiently about wage slaves for one semester though. Or at least I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her discussion about marriage as being akin to the contract between a prostitute and her client was applicable. I guess. I mean, it&amp;#8217;s not like I&amp;#8217;ve never thought about it in those terms, I&amp;#8217;ve just never thought about it as being the exact parallel for the marriage contract, or built into civil society. I think prostitution should be legalized, personally, for the purpose of improving standards for something that will happen anyway—I was fascinated reading this chapter.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I find her original argument, that social contract is both a political and sexual contract, that led, at least in its original form, to a patriarchal civil society, to be pretty persuasive. I do not think the book was particularly well-organized or written, and I thought there were a number of digressions and side-arguments that were deeply unnecessary, but after reading the book I&amp;#8217;m at least convinced that her reinterpretation of social contract is both innovative and useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judith Butler&amp;#8217;s text is more familiar to me, as both my thesis advisor and my faculty supervisor at my old school were heavily involved in queer theory and taught classes on it annually, so I&amp;#8217;ve read excerpts before and some articles by Butler. I liked her preface, both because of the humility it displays and in that she makes her point pretty clear—feminist theory was, and in some ways still is, pervasively heterosexual, and focuses on traditional gender identities and how they affect the world. The discussion of gender and what it means is productive ground for study—I&amp;#8217;m taking &amp;#8220;Gender and Sexuality in Early Christianity&amp;#8221; this semester, and it&amp;#8217;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#8217;m slightly interested in this basis in &amp;#8220;French Theory.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as of this point, all I can read on Google Books in the Preface. I&amp;#8217;ll happily read the other chapters when a course link is provided—Butler is a great writer, and while gender theory is not my area, it is interesting ground to tread.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-2744478786445409601?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;When First reading &lt;em&gt;History Matters &lt;/em&gt;by Judith Bennett, I was struck with the natural thought that what she initially called for was anything but history. What she was calling for, it might seem, would lead to bad or incomplete history, and I was not sure exactly how to argue its inevitability since, like other interdisciplinary schools, it is in many ways self-policing. However, when she started talking about &amp;#8220;patriarchy&amp;#8221; as the unifying feature of all feminist history, their stance became clear: that  women looked to the past and realize their identity was determined by anything except their own qualities, it struck me that this was merely their argument. By watching the present for signs of past wrong, Bennett is merely calling for an internal call not for the heads of men but the dignity of the&amp;nbsp;self.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Bennett, Judith M.  &lt;em&gt;History Matter: Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism&lt;/em&gt;.  Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,&amp;nbsp;2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joan Scott, &amp;#8220;Gender: A Useful Category of Analysis,&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;American Historical Review&lt;/em&gt; 19.5 (1986):&amp;nbsp;1053-1075.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning Bennet, I found it curious how the feminist struggle took shape in different countries &amp;#8220;especially influenced by socialism in Britain, shaped by Marxism in China, interested in women&amp;#8217;s culture in the United States, allied with sociology in Brazil, and fractured by &amp;#8216;woman&amp;#8217; versus &amp;#8216;gender&amp;#8217; in Japan.&amp;#8221;(pg&amp;nbsp;4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her pluralism to other socio-histories is convincing, race, class and Gender(many other factors of course) history are not at competition to see which has more sway in the plight of societies in history, rather they all play their respective roles in&amp;nbsp;combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy the medievalist within her and how she rightly pointed out that in American culture there is an odd understanding that &amp;#8220;old&amp;#8221; is inherently bad, and &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; is inherently good.  She explains that this is due to the United States being a young country with no interest in harkening back to before its creation as it would remind them of a &amp;#8220;tradition-bound, elitist, European past, as past that has been properly replaced by the dynamism of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; democracy and multiculturalism.&amp;#8221;(pg&amp;nbsp;34)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I enjoyed her defense of pre-modern and early modern history, her eventual purposes I found conflict with.  Her ultimate goal of rejoining feminist history and feminist activism is an incorrect goal.  That in my view, is abusing history, like a Nationalist would claim a link to the people that just so happened to be in his geographic area 500 years before, and gather that the exploits of those people applied to him in the&amp;nbsp;present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning Scott, I had very little issue the use of the word Gender as she proposed it, so I tended to agree with what she was&amp;nbsp;saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel=&#34;nofollow&#34; href=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/porto2360.wordpress.com/86/&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=porto2360.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=15303617&amp;amp;post=86&amp;amp;subd=porto2360&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed Bennett&amp;#8217;s book, though I have a few small points of disagreement about it.  She argues that feminist activism and history should be more closely aligned, and she presents reasons for why they have diverged since second wave feminism took hold in the 1970s: the need for women&amp;#8217;s history to be accepted, presentism, and the move away from history by feminist scholars in literature and other fields.  The discussion of presentism, and Bennett&amp;#8217;s negative view of it, form a strong secondary thesis to the book, one that I, as a medievalist, appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;TA&lt;/span&gt; this semester who&amp;#8217;s seeing a western civilization textbook for the first time (my undergrad survey professor hated them and assigned us several primary sources instead), I certainly see Bennett&amp;#8217;s point about women being added on as an afterthought in the master narrative.  At the same time, I think she, at times, goes a little too far: women certainly should be included in narratives of the medieval period, but Christine de Pisan, for example, while interesting, doesn&amp;#8217;t merit the same weight as Gregory of Tours.  At the same time, women such as Eleanor d&amp;#8217;Aquitaine and Emma of Normandy certainly deserve more attention than they receive.  They are the &amp;#8220;women worthies,&amp;#8221; but as Bennett says, it&amp;#8217;s not hard to include &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;and nuns&amp;#8221; when discussing monasteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As said, I appreciated Bennett&amp;#8217;s defense of the medieval period throughout in her assertion that feminist scholars need to look beyond 1800 in order to examine continuities and changes.  Events in the 1800s, whether concerning women or men, sometimes have roots in earlier time periods, and those should be considered.  I disagree, however, in her attempts to make the past relevant to students today.  I agree that the &amp;#8220;past is a foreign country,&amp;#8221; and while we can find parallels to today&amp;#8217;s society, the idea that Value X is important today just as it was in 1300 is uncritical.  Past events can inform what we do today, but finding those links isn&amp;#8217;t the goal of history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was already familiar with the ideas in Scott&amp;#8217;s article, that &amp;#8220;gender&amp;#8221; should have more theoretical meaning, and that the construct of gender is different from biologically-determined &amp;#8220;sex.&amp;#8221;  However, it was nice to read the argument in her words.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6220711600267285330-279569834366644749?l=jawhite21.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;This weeks assigned readings were Joan Scott&amp;#8217;s 1986 article&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Gender: A Useful Category of Analysis,&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp; and Judith Bennett&amp;#8217;s, &lt;u&gt;History Matters&lt;/u&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I found these two works to be quite instructional on a subject about which I have very little knowledge.&amp;nbsp; I was unaware there was such a heated debate among feminist historians about how to best define and do feminist history.&amp;nbsp; Judith Bennett actually quotes Joan Scott directly in her conclusion as someone whose philosophy of &amp;#8220;simply comparing data about women didn&amp;#8217;t get us very far,&amp;#8221; places her firmly in the category of the &amp;#8216;third wave&amp;#8217; of feminism she seems to feel is more a Sex in the City style feminism in comparison to her hard-core &amp;#8216;second wave&amp;#8217; of feminism in the 1970s.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&amp;nbsp;agree with Bennett&amp;#8217;s basic points,&amp;nbsp;I disagree in some ways with how she might put them into practice.&amp;nbsp; For example,&amp;nbsp;I agree that feminism should be confrontational to inequalities against women&amp;nbsp;today, and, where possible, history should be used to clarify/bolster this position.&amp;nbsp; At the same time, I don&amp;#8217;t think the idea of creating a category identifying &amp;#8216;lesbian-like&amp;#8217; behavior in order to create more historical precedents, sources,&amp;nbsp;or foundations for research is necessarily a good idea.&amp;nbsp; Another conclusion Bennett makes is that the patriarchal system has come to be ignored due to its unpopularity among postfeminists and general crticism of talk of women&amp;#8217;s oppression being&amp;nbsp;amateurish and overly emotional.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, as&amp;nbsp;Bennett clearly points out, the gender movement has&amp;nbsp;branched out into many finer forms of argument, and&amp;nbsp;universal history has gone by the wayside.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps&amp;nbsp;patriarchy is the universal system of feminism, and maybe&amp;nbsp;the system is being refined, and, over time, will be redefined.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems Bennett feels jaded by the transition in focus from&amp;nbsp;feminism to gender study, but she does admit the new outlook shows an overall maturation of the field.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In that respect, you can&amp;#8217;t have your cake and eat it too.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand Joan Scott&amp;#8217;s article is a look at the use of &amp;#8220;gender as a way of referring to the social organization of the relationship between the sexes,&amp;#8221; (pg 1053).&amp;nbsp; In my opinion, this&amp;nbsp;more inclusive approach seems more enlightened than Bennett&amp;#8217;s, and may actually serve better to solve her problems with fodder for medieval research and beyond.&amp;nbsp; In Scott&amp;#8217;s view, no understanding of the feminine can be achieved without attempts at understanding the male in the same ways.&amp;nbsp; While this makes perfect sense to me, this&amp;nbsp;is likely to&amp;nbsp;be just the&amp;nbsp;theory that Bennett considers a further homogenization of her beloved&amp;nbsp;field.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8880139849602883287-6297725524616569493?l=dixonro.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;It is a paradox endemic to the American character: We feel that a better tomorrow is our birthright, even as are quick to disregard the lessons of yesterday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know that&amp;#8217;s basically a variation on what Santayana said. But it&amp;#8217;s a notion that is compellingly laid out in Judith M. Bennett&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;History Matters: Patriarchy and the Challenges of Feminism.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the ways that women&amp;#8217;s lot has improved, Bennett says, there remains a glass ceiling, and its name is patriarchy. This system is so pervasive as to be, like glass, practically invisible. And even when gender diversity comes to formerly male-dominated institutions, patriarchy lingers as a largely unquestioned norm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am male. I also have a wife and a young daughter. And I am not aware that I have actively engaged in any oppression or subordination of the female population, nor do I have any desire to do so. But does that mean I&amp;#8217;ve never benefited from gender inequity? I don&amp;#8217;t know. Certainly, I&amp;#8217;ve not been oblivious to the constraints that some of my female relatives and friends have faced, but I suppose I&amp;#8217;ve been of the mindset that it&amp;#8217;s only a matter of time before such dynamics go the way of colonialism. Or slavery. Or Soviet communism. So I guess that brings us back to my original point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am old enough to remember the pejorative (a la Gloria Steinem) or at least quirky (a la Alan Alda) connotations that were assigned to feminism in its &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ERA&lt;/span&gt; heyday. Bennett&amp;#8217;s work makes clear why such was the take-home message for our mainstream culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Joan W. Scott&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis&amp;#8221; continues the cultural history theme by focusing on a very specific language issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long been aware that &amp;#8220;gender&amp;#8221; is not, technically speaking, a true synonym for sex, and yet I&amp;#8217;ve understood why the terms have come to be treated as interchangeable. And though I consider myself something of a stickler when it comes to linguistic matters, I&amp;#8217;ve not really been bothered by that particular practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, Scott&amp;#8217;s article left my head spinning. As she delves deeper, I can sort of understand her points on a case-by-case basis, but taken together, it&amp;#8217;s a lot to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Gender is a synonym for women.&amp;#8221; &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Gender is … a social category imposed on a sexed body.&amp;#8221; Gotcha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Gender is a constitutive element of social relationships based on perceived differences between the sexes, and gender is a primary way of signifying relationships of power.&amp;#8221; Ummmm … yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll be interested to see what light our discussion can shed on these ideas.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8399157107533224051-5627335213612219127?l=bumpusjournal.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;I was initially leery of the readings for this week simply because I tend to shy away in general from feminism and women&amp;#8217;s history. To my mind, feminist history conjures images of resentful women creating female-only histories that do the exact same thing as their male-centered counterparts do, only switching the subjects&amp;#8217; sex. With this mindset, therefore, I was quite relieved to discover that both the article and the book shunned this approach in favor of a more mutually balanced history of women that focused primarily on integration. I thought both texts provided well-reasoned arguments for the broader incorporation of women&amp;#8217;s history into more mainstream history and why such a development would prove useful to the overall profession.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Joan Scott&amp;#8217;s article focused mainly on the term &amp;#8220;gender&amp;#8221; and the position this idea currently holds in the historical profession. According to Scott, gender has traditionally entailed two different aspects: descriptive power and theoretical power. For much of its existence, gender has primarily been employed in its descriptive form rather than its analytical one. Scott, however, argues that gender would serve a more useful purpose as an analytical category used to better understand human relations. Gender as a theoretical tool rejects any biological implications of the term and is instead regarded as a means of examining culturally constructed social identities. What I found most interesting about this interpretation of gender is the universality it implies for both historical applications and sex in a biological sense. Gender is not only appropriate for the study of women doing traditionally female activities, but it can now be expanded to include studies of male politics. Scott argues, convincingly I believe, that the subtle effects of gender extend into all areas of human relationships. Things such as the cult of manliness and traditional ideas of male protection all fall within the category of &amp;#8220;gender&amp;#8221;, thus justifying the incorporation of gender studies into traditionally male-dominated spheres. I also found the somewhat ambiguous nature of Scott&amp;#8217;s conception of gender to be intriguing; her argument that gender identity, although operating under an illusion of coherence, is actually a constantly shifting phenomenon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;As much as I enjoyed Scott&amp;#8217;s article, I was surprised to find that I liked &lt;i&gt;History Matters&lt;/i&gt; by Judith Bennett even more. The overall style of the book was well done, from the clear organization to the relaxed yet professional prose. In addition, as a medievalist I appreciated her use of medieval examples, which I believe made the book even more interesting. When I first read the book&amp;#8217;s title, I expected another generalized argument for the overall usefulness of history, not an argument for the greater incorporation of history into women&amp;#8217;s studies. Needless to say, I appreciate her chosen course much more. Although I am not a strong proponent of women&amp;#8217;s history, this book forced me to ponder if perhaps that might not be because of the forward-minded approach taken by many feminists that Bennett argues against. According to Bennett, the study of women&amp;#8217;s history is in great need of historical help to strengthen the discipline in terms of accuracy and potential efficacy. I strongly agree with her assertion that feminists need to look back to the past to truly understand and work to address women&amp;#8217;s subservient position in society. One of my favorite parts of this book was Bennett&amp;#8217;s argument for a theory of continuity in women&amp;#8217;s history rather than periods of foundational change that currently dominates. Personally, I imagined from Bennett&amp;#8217;s argument a dual existence of women&amp;#8217;s history where the foundational layer, the system of patriarchy, remained constant while the upper layer reflected societal change. Even though shifts may occur on this upper level, such as the status rise of a previously female-dominated trade, counter changes will arise to insure the foundation of patriarchy remains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;For me, the most interesting part of Bennett&amp;#8217;s book was her analysis of patriarchy. As she points out, many historians shy away from such charged terms as &amp;#8220;patriarchy&amp;#8221;, particularly historians of women seeking to maintain academic legitimacy. Bennett, however, argues that this dismissal of patriarchy is not only inaccurate but ultimately detrimental to women&amp;#8217;s history. I found myself agreeing with her use of patriarchy as a concept around which historians of women can focus their study and not, thankfully, as a meta-narrative. Patriarchy is such a useful starting point for study because of its constant pervasiveness in society; although it has existed in different forms over the centuries, patriarchy has remained constantly present to insure the inferior status of women. The overall effect of the patriarchal system has been to keep women socially, economically and politically disadvantaged, but this does not mean that patriarchy was universally bad. In fact, Bennett suggests that patriarchy has survived so long because women have found ways to exist in and take advantage of the system, ultimately contributing to its endurance. This aspect of Bennett&amp;#8217;s argument was particularly interesting to me and her fair-mindedness greatly improved the substantial respect I already held for her as a scholar. Bennett&amp;#8217;s brief study of brewsters in England to illustrate her points was particularly enjoyable, and I fully recommend her complete study &lt;i&gt;Ale Beer and Brewsters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;The readings for this week once again pleasantly surprised me, and I found them to be particularly useful because they countered so many unfounded misgivings I held toward women&amp;#8217;s history. Both pieces presented convincing arguments for the applicability of gender studies to the broader historical profession as well as providing useful theoretical tools for doing so. I am still not as interested in women&amp;#8217;s history as much as other areas such as religion, but I certainly hold greater appreciation now. More importantly, Scott and Bennett have convinced me that gender and patriarchy play a role worthy note in non-traditional areas of study, and I hope I will keep such considerations in mind in future studies.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-1537872777026288014?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Judith Bennett, &lt;em&gt;History Matters: Patriarch and the Challenge of Feminism&lt;/em&gt; | Joan Scott, &amp;#8220;Gender: A Useful Category of&amp;nbsp;Analysis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading Bennett&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;History Matters&lt;/em&gt;, I am utterly lost as to what she perceived the impact of her book to be.  She rants against the male-dominated hierarchy of professional history, demands a greater focus on pre-modern women&amp;#8217;s history, and an increased attention to the oppression of women in all periods of historical investigation.  The entirety of her book came to little more than a lament for the separation of professional history and feminist activism.  Taking such an approach, her argument seems confusing at best and incomprehensible at&amp;nbsp;worst. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because she is a professional historian, perhaps the greatest insult to her and the tripe she calls a book is to say she suffers from nostalgia.  While Bennett asserts her lack of nostalgia (153), she frequently reminds the reader that she wants to restore the feminism that has been lost.  She writes: &amp;#8220;This book seeks to recover &amp;#8230; [the] ideal of a seamless union of history and feminism&amp;#8221; (1); &amp;#8220;Feminist activists and scholars, once so steeped in history have lost interest in the past&amp;#8221; (29); &amp;#8220;it is time for historians of women and gender to regain our feminist indignation&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;(154). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entirety of Bennett&amp;#8217;s argument is that &amp;#8220;women&amp;#8217;s history seems to be losing its feminist edge; deferring unnecessarily to male authority, dwelling overmuch on biographies of unusual women, taking a sharp cultural turn away from social and material considerations, attending more to diversity than to power differentials, and allying with a history of masculinity that is developing in surprisingly problematic ways&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;(22-3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite her constant rant about what is wrong with women&amp;#8217;s history today, she never comes to any sufficient conclusion as to why the loss of militant feminism is such a terrible thing for women and gender historians.  Because the historiography of women and gender has become so widespread and culturally inclusive, Bennett suggests that it has lost its feminist edge.  Perhaps she adequately describes the expansion of women&amp;#8217;s history and its pluralistic development over the last four decades, but she fails to explain why the evolution of an inclusive, globalized point of view is such a terrible thing for the women&amp;#8217;s movement or for the genre or women&amp;#8217;s history.  It seems that history only matters for Bennett when it is explicitly political and specifically affirms her feminist point of&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joan Scott, on the other hand, presents a more logical and understandable perspective of the women and gender field of history.  She suggests that the term gender fits nicely into the social construct of expectations pertaining to men and women.  Like Bennett, Scott suggests that there is a trend within professional history to be more inclusive in historical investigations which naturally brings differences of class, race, and gender to the fore (1054).  Scott goes on, however, to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the theories and viewpoints which dominate the current historiography of women and&amp;nbsp;gender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott succeeds because she is able to form a coherent argument for the inclusion of gender-based examinations.  She argues that because gender is a &amp;#8220;constitutive element of social relationships based on perceived differences between the sexes&amp;#8221; as &amp;#8220;a primary way of signifying relationships of power&amp;#8221; (1067), that it may open new perspectives in examining historical actors.  Owing to its creation as a social construct, gender-based analyses are applicable to nearly all realms of historical inquiry, from class, to race, to politics.  Scott argues that &amp;#8220;historically specific, normative definitions of gender&amp;#8221; are &amp;#8220;reproduced and embedded&amp;#8221; in the culture of people, time, or place (1073).  Because &amp;#8220;gender is one of the recurrent references by which political power has been conceived legitimated and criticized&amp;#8221; (1073) it may provide a better understanding of the motivation and ideals of the period and people under&amp;nbsp;investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The subtitle of this book is Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism, and Bennett certainly featured both of those topics, but the main point I got from the book is that History Matters.  She almost always couched this claim in terms of it mattering for feminist strategy, but I saw this book primarily as a manifesto for the importance of studying pre-1800 history, even beyond its usefulness to just feminism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was reassuring to have her insist so often that we study the events in history because they&amp;#8217;re useful for our need in the present.  I seem to recall a previous discussion in class that historians are not supposed to read history in order to find insights for today.  I felt then, and still think now, that that is nonsense.  If you don&amp;#8217;t find patterns and causalities and implications for the events in your historical studies, then you only have a list of facts, like an antiquarian.  If you do find these, they will inform your perceptions of other events and trends, including the ones around you.  So, in answer to her claim that &amp;#8220;this is a book…intended to help us think more generally about history, patriarchy, and feminism,&amp;#8221; (3), I would say she did a better job with the first than the second and third goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was interesting to keep a tally of every time she reiterated her claim that studying history could inform current strategy (pages 1,4,5,33 [repeated almost verbatim 42-43], 50, 60, 106, 129, 138, and 154, in case you&amp;#8217;re interested).  Hers is a more focused and political perspective, but by removing just a few descriptors, she makes an excellent case for studying history, period.  &amp;#8220;history provides…long-term perspectives essential to building a better long-term future&amp;#8221; (4), &amp;#8220;I believe that modern history is impoverished by inattention to the premodern past…&amp;#8221; (133) &amp;#8220;The power of [fill in your current problem] in our lives today partly rests, in other words, on our failure to understand how it has worked in past times&amp;#8221; (60) &amp;#8220;If they would look further down the &amp;#8216;long cool corridors of the past,&amp;#8217; [they] would see their short-term data in a different light.&amp;#8221; (106)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The past is particularly suited to examining emotionally fraught issues of today, like the patriarchy and feminism that Bennett is interested in, because the distance lends objectivity and dispassion that enable clearer thinking and sharper insights.  That&amp;#8217;s one of the reasons morality tales have so often been set long ago or &amp;#8220;peopled&amp;#8221; with animals—it&amp;#8217;s easier to talk about selfishness over there in them than to recognize it inside yourself.  She returns to this benefit of history less often than the strategy angle, but on pages 52, 146, and 149 she does so quite eloquently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What she did less eloquently, but no less often, was to defend her terminology.  Endlessly.  Women on page 9, objectivity (positivism) on page 14, patriarchy on page 55, and her pet phrase, &amp;#8220;lesbian-like&amp;#8221; all through chapter six.  I wish she could have explained herself briefly and then moved on to her point, leaving the agonizing defense of her vocabulary choices for the footnotes.  In the case of lesbian-like especially, I lost sight of her point, unless the only point of chapter six was to campaign for her new word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that (and the fact that footnote 16 on age 133 didn&amp;#8217;t answer my question) this was an excellent book.  I appreciated its defense of premodern history, I enjoyed the description and analysis of the brewsters&amp;#8217; situation, and I picked up many shiny thoughts to squirrel away for future consideration.  She made a good case for the usefulness of grand narratives and overarching structures even as she pointed out their limits.  On page 131 she hit the nail on the head with the benefit of conventional textbooks—they should only be expected to provide the foundation, thereby freeing the teacher space to incorporate the magic.  And she gave a great testimony to the power of incrementalism and moderation in her story on pages 135-137, about editing that textbook.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-4693696104542897736?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Joan Scott notes the creation of the term &amp;#8220;gender&amp;#8221; to apply to the socially constructed expectations that surround the biological division of male and female. Instead of using the term &amp;#8220;sex,&amp;#8221; which conjures up both sexual activity and a certain biological determinism, &amp;#8220;gender&amp;#8221; denotes a distinction from a study of physical difference to a study of male-female dynamics. Women&amp;#8217;s or gender history is an expanding field, though as Judith Bennett points out, it is not without its detractors. There is a larger disciplinary trend within History to expand the topics of historical study. This includes increases awareness of class, race, religion, and now gender, as well(Scott, 1054; Bennett, 142). Like these other fields, there is tension within gender history over inclusiveness, as some studies stop short of full integration into the analysis of the period and instead just add a few interesting case studies of particular individuals. In addition to call historians to do more than create biographies for a few &amp;#8220;women worthies,&amp;#8221; Scott also looks at the strengths and weaknesses of current theories to explain patriarchy, or male&amp;nbsp;dominance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While her points are well-taken that women taking the primary responsibility for childcare is not biologically determined (in fact, there are some cultures where the man had primary childcare responsibility), I do think she underplays the period of nursing after the child is born, which certainly marks the woman as necessary to the child&amp;#8217;s care. Her attention to the pattern that seems to emerge of female suppression when new regime takes over, despite a lack of economic incentive to disadvantage that group, is strong evidence for the issue of patriarchy. It seems one of the popular and effective strategies for cementing a new rule is to first &amp;#8220;put women in their place,&amp;#8221; which is, to me, powerful evidence to the political implications of patriarchy and a lens through which the traditionally male-dominated field of political history, could be opened to included gender(Scott,&amp;nbsp;1072).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one part of Bennett&amp;#8217;s book that was particularly intriguing to me was her analysis of the Virgin Mary. As both the ideal woman and the intercessor, female virtue is embodied in this central religious figure; that much has always been clear. However, the more nuanced interpretations of Mary as both mother and bride, virgin and mother, new mother and bereaved parent, create an impossible standard that women cannot achieve as well as connecting female worth and authority entirely to their connection to men(Bennet, 146). Both of these have real implications for women&amp;#8217;s place within society, then and&amp;nbsp;now. &lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Let me start with the article for a change, because usually by the time I get done with blogging about our weekly book I don&amp;#8217;t really have anything left to say, and it gets neglected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening discussion on gendered language reminds me of why my French grammar is terrible, despite being a native speaker. My grandparents will never let me live down my rants as a kid about how trees were neither male nor female, and my general disdain for having to learn whether a word was masculine or feminine. Of course, I can now see the phallic symbolism in a tree, and I understand language much better than I did then, but I still hate the way words are gendered in ways that make no sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gender is a useful category for historical analysis&amp;#8212;it isn&amp;#8217;t the one I&amp;#8217;m most comfortable with, but that is slowly but surely changing. The discussions of gender identity in Gender and Sexuality in Early Christianity, the class I&amp;#8217;m taking with Dr. Shepardson, have been lively and enlightening, and I&amp;#8217;m starting to see how it can be a good direction for me to look at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gender theory, and its use in history, are areas fairly murky to me, but between the article and the book I have a much better sense of why women&amp;#8217;s history requires such a theoretical approach if it is going to really be women&amp;#8217;s history, as opposed to the kind of panacea described in parts of both texts. The barest mention of women in textbooks without altering the grand narrative of history, the inclusion of &amp;#8220;notable women&amp;#8221; without mentioning the lives of the commoners, and the idea of history as progress are all counterproductive to creating a truly synthetic history—one that takes into account both men and women equally, and uses both of their experiences to create a new narrative structure, rather than grafting on a thin outer layer of equality without really changing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed this book much more than I thought I would. Honestly, the title kind of scared me: &lt;em&gt;History Matter: Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism&lt;/em&gt;. The word &amp;#8220;patriarchy&amp;#8221; has all kinds of really negative, man-hating connotations in my mind, and I appreciate that Bennett toke the time to forthrightly address these kinds of concerns. I don&amp;#8217;t disagree with her definition of patriarchy, a social system that is inherently man-centric, or the use of feminist theory and critique in history being to show that, within a social group under the same circumstances, women are disadvantaged in comparison to men. It was a really nonthreatening way of going about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what I found most useful about this book was not the actual feminist theory; I&amp;#8217;ve been exposed to it before, and while this text managed to reverse the vision of it I had had before, that wasn&amp;#8217;t really what did it for me (though the historical examples were really neat). What I liked best about this book was the way in which it dealt with the historical profession and genre in general. The emphasis on a political use of history, without necessarily returning to the nationalistic genre of history writing or skewing facts, is important to me—mostly because she uses this as a springboard for how to make history, and especially premodern history, relevant. That the kind of thing I wish there was more honest debate about, and I found her discussion, with all the pitfalls waiting for feminist women&amp;#8217;s history in academia and the broader world, refreshing and engaging. The problem of conforming to the academy&amp;#8217;s expectations in order not to be judged amateurish is one that worries me, with my own, personal goals, so it was nice to hear not only her personal experience, but an entire discipline&amp;#8217;s struggle in this way.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-6084614164221970179?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Does a historian need empathy to understand the&amp;nbsp;past?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, yes.  Empathy as I understand it, is understanding the emotions of people from the past and withholding our judgement of them.  It is rather presumptuous to think that one can truly understand what a person felt in, for example, the Reconquista on either side of the conflict but plenty of clues and decent guess work can land a historian in the right direction and like most things in the historical field, trying is a good portion of the battle! I must admit though&amp;#8230; passing judgement always seems to sell books, Crusaders as evil doers or heroes seem to stock the  minuscule medieval history shelf at  any Barnes &lt;span class=&#34;amp&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Noble or Borders book&amp;nbsp;store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Should the historian have the obligation to approach that past culture with the anthropologist&amp;#8217;s cultural&amp;nbsp;relativism?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. I feel this is limiting the historian to a specific view and I am far to pluralist to allow this to happen.  I enjoy reading different schools of thought on the same period as they keep each other in&amp;nbsp;check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Finally, is &amp;#8220;culture&amp;#8221;, and however *you* define that term, an indispensable object of historical inquiry? Is it the most significant? How do you define&amp;nbsp;it?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, to define &amp;#8220;culture,&amp;#8221; I have no problem with the anthropological definition of the way of living done by a group of people at a certain point in time.  And culture gives context to historical inquiry, I would be weary of separating them.  Concerning it significance, it depends on the question asked, after a context is established the historical inquiry could deal with an infinite amount of topics, and culture itself wont be the main&amp;nbsp;discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

Empathy, the ability to really get into the mindset or feelings of others, is a very useful ability in life; when you tell your friends &amp;#8220;I feel for you,&amp;#8221; you&amp;#8217;re at least claiming empathy, and a lack in empathy makes any social interaction much more difficult, let alone a study abroad experience or reading works in a foreign language. When you&amp;#8217;re a historian, empathy allows you to take a relatively unbiased look at a period, to at least attempt to get inside the mindset of the historical actors and view them from their own context, rather than your own—even when you fail (as you inevitably will), at least you will have made the attempt and gotten closer than you would otherwise. In the case of the Crusades, my area of study, the use of empathy allows me to look at the sack of Jerusalem through the eyes of the fighters—tired, hungry, thirsty, baking under the sun, having undertaken the longest land journey imaginable for someone in Western Europe, harassed by Muslim armies the entire way, devoid of effective leadership, angry, filled with religious zeal… That doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that I have to approve of their actions, or not condemn the slaughter in Jerusalem, but I can understand how it came to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that I necessarily agree with moral relativism.

            <title type="html">Foucault</title>
            <author><name>Chad Black</name></author>
            <link href="/history510/blog/foucault.html"/>
            <updated>2010-10-31T22:39:46Z</updated>
            <published>2010-10-31T22:39:46Z</published>
            <id>/history510/blog/foucault.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Foucault starts the book with a public execution for a man convicted of regicide in 1757. He rightfully spares no detail in the proceedings of the execution, notable for its terrorizing use of state-sponsored violence(3-5). These details are necessary because it is central to his work that this type of sentence blurred the line between crime and punishment. Foucault incisively looks at the changing philosophies of the penal system, including notions of punishment from physical pain to the suspension of liberties, the concern over the body or the soul of the detained, and the role of judges and nature of judgments(19, 21).  I was particularly interested in this section on the way the vengeance of the king was carried out, since an affront to the law is an attack on the king&amp;#8217;s figurative person. However, the king did not actually carry out this vengeance, himself, and could always provide a dramatic pardon, much to the crowd&amp;#8217;s delight(53). Thus the king could maintain a certain distance from the actual carnage, while the bloodshed was done in his name and by his&amp;nbsp;command(49).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, the executioner had an interesting connection to social control. He bears the brunt of association with state-ordered killing, and is quickly reprimanded if the execution is not carried out correctly. If he administers too much pain, he could be mercilessly insulted and even attacked by the crowd, and if he fails, the person could be freed(though this practice is later stopped)(52). This connects to the designated notion of pain punishments, as a particular amount of pain was to be exacted in response to particular crimes. Even if the person was condemned to death, the crowd watched to be sure they got death only once, unless their punishment specifically decreed otherwise. I had always thought &amp;#8220;die a thousand deaths,&amp;#8221; was a hyperbole, but it in fact denotes a particular way of killing a person, seemingly equivalent to the pain of dying many times. This system was further refined as punishments were specifically related to the crime (symbolic punishments, especially) and to the amount of pain deserved ( 45,&amp;nbsp;89).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This show of force could backfire if the crowd sympathized with the convicted. If they died without blaspheming, they could be elevated to martyr-like status. If they died cursing authority, many in the crowd would enjoy that, too, and state officials were left with their &amp;#8220;authority mocked and criminals transformed into heroes.&amp;#8221;(61). The use of torture could also possibly backfire, as a person who stood up under being &amp;#8220;put to the question,&amp;#8221; could no longer be put to death, whatever other evidence was collected against&amp;nbsp;them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In switching focus to discipline, Foucault notes the way the body can be molded toward certain desirable ends, beginning with the example of a soldier. He then defines discipline, and says that &amp;#8220;the historical moment of the disciplines was the moment when the art of the human body was born, which was directed not only at the growth of skills, nor at the intensification of its subjection, but at the formation of a relation that in the mechanism itself makes it more obedient as it becomes more useful, and conversely(138).&lt;br /&gt;
I think this notion of discipline promoting usefulness is fascinating and is well documented in other parts of the section. Also important, and somewhat disturbing, is the idea of perfect observation, leading to the panopticism.&lt;br /&gt;
    Finally, Foucault&amp;#8217;s analysis of other methods of discipline and punishment toward the end of the book are well placed, since he is right to assert that concern over the penal system does not just take place during reform movements, but is in a more continual state of&amp;nbsp;development(235). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussion tomorrow, I hope we can devote some time to these questions, (among others) since these topics were of particular interest to&amp;nbsp;me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the role of the crowd relate to the system of public punishment? How can it enhance and undermine the effectiveness of the&amp;nbsp;punishment? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does Foucault define discipline and how does this shape this argument for the latter half of the&amp;nbsp;book? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does religion seem to intersect penal theory, in its various stages of&amp;nbsp;development?  &lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discipline and Punish&lt;/em&gt;, Michel&amp;nbsp;Foucault&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Discipline and Punish&lt;/em&gt;, Foucault argues for a philosophical shift in the punishment of criminals brought about most notably by the French Revolution and the Enlightenment.  These developments altered the state&amp;#8217;s foundation of legitimacy, transferring it from the divine right of kings to the social contract.  Crime itself was changing, too.  The demise of the last vestiges of feudal France brought a new set of property relations as capitalism flourished.  Capitalistic property relations saw a &amp;#8220;shift from the criminality of blood to a criminality of fraud&amp;#8221; where crime was no longer violent and directed at people, but deceitful and directed at property&amp;nbsp;(77). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, &amp;#8220;the power to judge&amp;#8221; no longer depended &amp;#8220;on the innumerable, discontinuous, sometimes contradictory privileges of sovereignty, but on the continuously distributed effects of public power&amp;#8221; (81).  Logically extending from these developments, the punishment of crimes took on the model of the social contract, whereby the right to punish was shifted from the vengeance of sovereigns &amp;#8220;to the defence [sic] of society&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;(90).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less concerned with exacting blood for blood, the punishment of criminals under this new system is concerned with the &amp;#8220;collective coercion of bodies&amp;#8221; (169).  The main function of the power to discipline is &amp;#8220;to &amp;#8216;train&amp;#8217;, rather than to select and to levy&amp;#8221; punishments upon transgressors (170).  Under the social contract where crime is prosecuted as a defense of society, the punishment of criminals is not designed to force them out of society but to coerce their compliance with the social contract—to train them to be good&amp;nbsp;citizens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through hierarchical observation (that is observation of the masses by some vested authority), normalized judgment (where the knowledge of individuals was used to rank them according to their potential), and examination (the pedagogical science of treating the individual as a case study), outside authorities placed an arbitrary value on the individual offender so that a treatment may be developed to rehabilitate the&amp;nbsp;offender.     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Discipline and Punish&lt;/em&gt;, Foucault presents not just an argument for the evolution of a modern penal movement, but a larger philosophical suggestion that a power-knowledge dialectic has emerged which is rooted in the institutionalization of science and knowledge.  Perhaps the strangest extension of his system is the recasting of power from a negative, exclusionary or oppressive element in society to that of a generative or producing element.  Under such a view, the modern individual is little more than a composite of the empirical data obtained through being observed.  Such a view fits nicely within Foucault&amp;#8217;s Carceral Continuum where all social relations are relegated, in some form or another to the pervasive desire to identify&amp;nbsp;deviance.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;What frightens me about the nature of our penetration system isn&amp;#8217;t the nature of those who go in, though certainly the socioeconomic slant is troubling. What bothers me more than anything is the nature of those who come out. It seems like &amp;#8220;reform&amp;#8221; might be to arbitrary a term and the process might be to broad to affect much actual&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, change is often stagnant because most of the effort for change is, for better or worse, rooted in the cause of the same socioeconomic slant that seems to prejudice some into more and longer incarceration than others. However, since justice, to many people, as an immediate connotation, the gap between &amp;#8220;prevention&amp;#8221; and implementation might never actually be breached; and many see them as the same function.  In effect, the implementation of punishment for some is a misplaced punishment of crime yet to be committed. Until people can transfer the excess of punishment into a concerted effort into improving  the socioeconomic factors that go into crime, they may always exist. Indeed, it seems as though until people begin to trust active social improvment over an over emphasis on incarceration than there will always be a sense of injustice in the justice&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;How ought society to deal with crime and criminals? What is the ultimate objective of &amp;#8220;justice&amp;#8221;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Foucault in his 1975 opus considers those thorny and age-old questions. And it is perhaps to his credit that in his treatment I found no real answers, but instead even more questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When considering the sick spectacle that was torture executions, many perhaps would be inclined to glory in the more enlightened state of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century humanity. But that, of course, would be foolish. Biologically, we are no different than they. Culturally, we are not at all far removed from their world. So what reason is there to think that we possess some inherent moral superiority that would preclude us from indulging in such coolly calculated atrocities as did they (or others in more recent centuries and decades)? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, as Foucault (Page 91) quotes Lacretelle saying, &amp;#8220;God, who has imprinted in our hearts an aversion to pain for ourselves and for our fellow men, are they then those same beings, whom thou has created so weak and so sensible, who have invented such barbarous, such refined tortures?&amp;#8221; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the purpose of punishing criminals, and the deeper psychological issues underlying that question, again I am unsure, and more to the point, I am unconvinced that our society is sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that the fashionable mindset remains this: &amp;#8220;The prison, though an administrative apparatus, will at the same time be a machine for altering minds&amp;#8221; (Page 125). &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;. But for better, or for worse? That&amp;#8217;s something else entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, these things trouble me.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8399157107533224051-8485898474798357188?l=bumpusjournal.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;When I first discovered that the book for this week was written by Michael Foucault, I must admit I was less than excited. I have not had much direct exposure to Foucault prior to reading this book, but what brief writings I had read and from hearing discussion of his idea, I was fairly sure that I would not enjoy his study. Although &lt;i&gt;Discipline and Punishment&lt;/i&gt; is still far from my favorite book assigned throughout this class, it was nonetheless much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. My biggest complaint stems from a personal distaste for strongly theoretical works, which Foucault&amp;#8217;s certainly is. The ideas he presents are interesting and thought-provoking, but I cannot bring myself to enjoy theoretical analysis as much as narrative forms of history. On the positive side, however, I found the foundational subject for this book, prisons and the shift in penal punishment, to be incredibly interesting. This is not a topic with which I am very familiar and I greatly enjoyed Foucault&amp;#8217;s treatment of the material. Another factor that stimulated my involvement with the book was t its surprisingly brutal nature. I appreciated Foucault&amp;#8217;s decision to incorporate such stories simply because, for me, the vivid descriptions helped counteract the somewhat callous and disassociated tone of the book.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;It took a great deal of time and rereading to get through &lt;i&gt;Discipline and Punishment&lt;/i&gt;, and even at the end I was unsure I completely understood all of Foucault&amp;#8217;s arguments. He puts forth a great deal of constructed relationships to help explain the shift in punishment that occurred from the mid eighteenth to mid nineteenth century, such as power-knowledge or body-object. Often these models prove useful for understanding Foucault&amp;#8217;s ideas, but it can be difficult to grasp the many nuances Foucault perceives to exist in these relationships. To my surprise, I found myself rather convinced by Foucault&amp;#8217;s argument that punishment shifted from a corporal form of vengeance to a disciplinary one focused on control. I believe there is much merit in his analysis of cultural shifts and their ensuing impact on how power was perceived during the advent of the modern age. Torture fell into disuse as the primary concern became the creation of &amp;#8220;docile bodies,&amp;#8221; which involve a subjugation of the mind- Foucault would argue the soul- rather than a subjugation of the body. According to Foucault, this necessitated the disassociation of power from the body as disciplinary institutions sought to increase the efficiency of the body while imposing a strict subjugation to ensure the power relationship. This new goal could only be achieved through constant surveillance and an ability to control. In addition, it must be achieved through non-violent means because the creation of a docile body is an internal phenomenon. Such criteria could not be met prior to the expansion of institutions and advent of modern technologies that occurred throughout into the nineteenth century.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Although I did enjoy this book, I would have like to see an in-depth expansion of Foucault&amp;#8217;s analysis beyond France. He addressed other countries as well, but I wondered to what extent his conclusions would apply to other countries, such as Spain, had they received the same level of attention as did France. Perhaps one of the most enjoyable aspects of this book was its though-provoking nature; I certainly reflected more upon this book and its implications than I do in most. I am not an unconditional supporter of Foucault&amp;#8217;s power theory, but I do find this interpretation to be very interesting because of its broad applicability. Personally, and I believe this holds true for most of Foucault&amp;#8217;s readers, I could not read this book without reflecting on contemporary penal institutions and the nature of the power-knowledge relationship in today&amp;#8217;s society. After reading and reflecting, I finally came down on the favorable side of the book despite my initial misgivings. Regardless of one&amp;#8217;s personal feelings toward Foucault, I believe that at least an awareness of his theories is important for any professional historian.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-6545597144546769369?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;When I first discovered that the book for this week was written by Michael Foucault, I must admit I was less than excited. I have not had much direct exposure to Foucault prior to reading this book, but what brief writings I had read and from hearing discussion of his idea, I was fairly sure that I would not enjoy his study. Although &lt;i&gt;Discipline and Punishment&lt;/i&gt; is still far from my favorite book assigned throughout this class, it was nonetheless much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. My biggest complaint stems from a personal distaste for strongly theoretical works, which Foucault&amp;#8217;s certainly is. The ideas he presents are interesting and thought-provoking, but I cannot bring myself to enjoy theoretical analysis as much as narrative forms of history. On the positive side, however, I found the foundational subject for this book, prisons and the shift in penal punishment, to be incredibly interesting. This is not a topic with which I am very familiar and I greatly enjoyed Foucault&amp;#8217;s treatment of the material. Another factor that stimulated my involvement with the book was t its surprisingly brutal nature. I appreciated Foucault&amp;#8217;s decision to incorporate such stories simply because, for me, the vivid descriptions helped counteract the somewhat callous and disassociated tone of the book.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;It took a great deal of time and rereading to get through &lt;i&gt;Discipline and Punishment&lt;/i&gt;, and even at the end I was unsure I completely understood all of Foucault&amp;#8217;s arguments. He puts forth a great deal of constructed relationships to help explain the shift in punishment that occurred from the mid eighteenth to mid nineteenth century, such as power-knowledge or body-object. Often these models prove useful for understanding Foucault&amp;#8217;s ideas, but it can be difficult to grasp the many nuances Foucault perceives to exist in these relationships. To my surprise, I found myself rather convinced by Foucault&amp;#8217;s argument that punishment shifted from a corporal form of vengeance to a disciplinary one focused on control. I believe there is much merit in his analysis of cultural shifts and their ensuing impact on how power was perceived during the advent of the modern age. Torture fell into disuse as the primary concern became the creation of &amp;#8220;docile bodies,&amp;#8221; which involve a subjugation of the mind- Foucault would argue the soul- rather than a subjugation of the body. According to Foucault, this necessitated the disassociation of power from the body as disciplinary institutions sought to increase the efficiency of the body while imposing a strict subjugation to ensure the power relationship. This new goal could only be achieved through constant surveillance and an ability to control. In addition, it must be achieved through non-violent means because the creation of a docile body is an internal phenomenon. Such criteria could not be met prior to the expansion of institutions and advent of modern technologies that occurred throughout into the nineteenth century.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Although I did enjoy this book, I would have like to see an in-depth expansion of Foucault&amp;#8217;s analysis beyond France. He addressed other countries as well, but I wondered to what extent his conclusions would apply to other countries, such as Spain, had they received the same level of attention as did France. Perhaps one of the most enjoyable aspects of this book was its though-provoking nature; I certainly reflected more upon this book and its implications than I do in most. I am not an unconditional supporter of Foucault&amp;#8217;s power theory, but I do find this interpretation to be very interesting because of its broad applicability. Personally, and I believe this holds true for most of Foucault&amp;#8217;s readers, I could not read this book without reflecting on contemporary penal institutions and the nature of the power-knowledge relationship in today&amp;#8217;s society. After reading and reflecting, I finally came down on the favorable side of the book despite my initial misgivings. Regardless of one&amp;#8217;s personal feelings toward Foucault, I believe that at least an awareness of his theories is important for any professional historian.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-6545597144546769369?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;To be frank, Foucault was an intimidating read. However, as I read along i found myself thinking I knew a great deal of what he was talking about and realized that it was Foucault&amp;#8217;s clear message that made itself the standard for our modern day understanding of crime and punishment.  I sincerely struggled to decipher its relevance to Historiography and it took conversations to fellow students to decide on a idea, that being that culture is merely the rituals of&amp;nbsp;power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Foucault is chronicling punishment and its uses by the royal authority and its change into punishment by state authority, it can be understood as an exercise of power to denote cultural change. His exploration of the purposes of Torture really demonstrate this.  Looking at culture in this way did however leave a sour taste in my mouth, particularly with Punishment.  The shift of Punishment from public torture to Prison was most interesting.  The message that punishment sends to the masses(for lack of a better word) that is the direction of power, as I understood&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;I first opened Foucault&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Discipline and&amp;nbsp;Punish:&amp;nbsp;The Birth&amp;nbsp;of the Prison&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;a while back.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;After the first few pages I knew I would not have wanted to be a criminal, and I put it down.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;After finishing it this week, it was interesting, and a little strange.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The writing was rough.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I&amp;#8217;m guessing it was translated from French, which explains a bit.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I really hate it when a writer says something like, &amp;#8216;there are four items of import. First,&amp;#8221; and then there is never a second, third, or fourth, you just have to guess what the others are.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Once I got past that, it got a little better.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Moving from a tortured death to public executions, the idea was to make people not want to commit the crime, which was covered very graphically in the first chapter.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This was on the idea that the crime was essentially against the king, and he was exacting vengeance.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;Once the move was made to reform the way punishment was handled, things began to change.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;They still kept the different punishments for different social strata – gentlemen could not be imprisoned by commoners, but the idea of reforming the criminal came about.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The old adage of letting the punishment fit the crime (104) and making crime not glamorous were nice.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;You can see a lot of modern prison ideas in the old reforms as well.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Like the idea of a punitive city, (113) sounds like the old penal farms, and placards and hats to distinguish the inmates gave way to prison jumpsuits.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;They also caught on that locking people up for all offenses would simply not work, so let&amp;#8217;s retrain them went the idea.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Along with time off for good behavior, you can see the Protestant work ethic being administered here in the idea that if they are taught to like work they will not return to criminal ways.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;The panopticon was an ingenious idea. I kind of thought of it like the surveillance cameras at the store.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;You&amp;#8217;re not sure if the camera inside that black ball is looking at you or not, and this is to keep down shoplifting.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Now, image a place where they beat you with a stick if the eye in the sky sees you get out of line.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;After all this fun, we move onto the retraining of the criminal by educating them, putting them to work at different endeavors, even the idea of chain-gangs to control order.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Yet, the author seems to return all the while to the idea that all the prisoners are really learning is how to be better criminals.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;In the end we see that the prison and punishment of criminals and delinquents are born within the society that produces them.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;If there was a way to remove the criminal desire from the person it would be a wonderful world.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;However, because there is a little outlaw in all of us, the prison will forever be within our society.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;Culture is significant when it comes to history, but I would not say it is more important than personal experience or class location as it pertains to the historical character you are researching.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Looking at a society as a whole, culture is still one aspect.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;There are several layers of society.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Take America for instance; we are considered to have a culture of consumerism and all are capitalists.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Yet, there are different groups within America that would differ from that assumption; like the Amish, Mennonites, socialists and communists groups, and many others.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Yes, culture is import to understand some things but it can&amp;#8217;t answer all things.&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Hmmm, last week the wink, this week the gaze…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cover of this book says it&amp;#8217;s about the birth of the prison, and the title includes the word punish.  I was not looking forward to reading it, and the first chapter more than confirmed my trepidation.  It went beyond making a point to pure sensationalism.  I was in a pretty foul mood as I began the rest of the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, even with a bad attitude and three nights of inadequate sleep, this book managed to be better than I&amp;#8217;d dreaded.  Within the framework of narrating the evolution from bodily punishment that proved the monarch&amp;#8217;s power to internal discipline and training as a more subtle and pervasive way to control behavior, Foucault made several observations that I appreciated.  And then, rereading a book for my historiography project, I thought I recognized an idea, and—yes!—Gorski had indeed included Foucault in his bibliography.  I feel like maybe I have a toe in the doorway to this club called History.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here are a few of the thoughts I had, in no particular order, since my brain is apparently on strike. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pg 98-99 different punishments for different people:  this is still true for teaching and parenting (an association I made over and over through this book, by the way) but we don&amp;#8217;t seem to apply it much for criminals, beyond cushy prisons for some and nasty prisons for others.  I wonder what stands in the way of discovering a criminal&amp;#8217;s button and then pushing it, instead of just using incarceration for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not the severity of punishment that&amp;#8217;s its best deterrent; it&amp;#8217;s the certainty of punishment.  I found that was true with teaching.  I could have a ridiculously minor punishment, but because it was so consistently applied, it really did keep the kids from misbehaving.  I wish we could apply this to greater society.  If jail were shorter but certain, with no hope of evading the police or getting off for some technicality, maybe it would be a better deterrent.  Really, after seeing what power a two-minute detention had, I&amp;#8217;d believe most anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He returned often to the relationship between power and knowledge.  He kept the discussion pretty close to his theme of prisons and punishment, but they interact in dozens of other ways in our society, too—lobbyist, expert testimony, psychologists overriding common wisdom, nutritional fads, scientists on a pedestal, and so on.  The person with the knowledge does have power over those who don&amp;#8217;t really know.  It works in arguments, too.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observation is an element of power.  How does that speak to anthropologists who observe groups of people—does that give them power over those groups?  Are there different kinds of observation, or just different uses for the results?  Observation yields knowledge, so that&amp;#8217;s related to the knowledge/power connection.  And again with the teaching—the better I knew my students, the more clearly I knew their buttons and could adjust their carrots and sticks.  I just can&amp;#8217;t get over how often this book was just parenting/teaching writ large.  No wonder I wanted out of public schools!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does bug me that I don&amp;#8217;t see why this book was included in the syllabus.  What did it contribute to the development of historiography?  What was Foucault&amp;#8217;s new angle or insight or paradigm?&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-3778686751177189112?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

What was Foucault&amp;#8217;s new angle or insight or paradigm?&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-3778686751177189112?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;When I started reading this book, two things struck me immediately—first, this was much more interesting than I expected, and secondly, I had no idea how it connected to historiography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quickly got at least one of the points. The opening section of Discipline and Punish shows a fundamental shift in Western thought not only on punishment but on the concept of the body and personal rights. The section, Torture, discusses the marked change from atrocity to humaneness in punishment rituals, looking at how it went from reflecting the horror of the crime physically back onto the criminal to having to demonstrate the humaneness of the ruler. This is really a description of the power dynamic between ruler and people; a breach of the law is a personal affront to the sovereign, requiring a display of the sovereign&amp;#8217;s power in order to rectify the challenge to his authority. The punishment is a ritual that confirms the ruler&amp;#8217;s power, and the societal model based on the ruler&amp;#8217;s power—the torture, the punishment, the confessions, etc., all are part of a rectifying of a breach of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that comes across most heavily, at least to me, is that culture and society are based on power relationships, and within this text punishment and law are the power relationship between the sovereignty of the ruler and/or the state in relation to the people. Activities like torture, imprisonment, etc., are all &amp;#8220;rituals of power,&amp;#8221; the trappings of these power relationships that allow it to function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The changes throughout the rest of the book, the change in punishment in general, is representative of both a change in government and a change in the perception of the body and its relationship to individual rights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foucault wasn&amp;#8217;t as intimidating as I thought. This is an interesting book, because I would not have thought that you could use such a specific historical analysis to explain a greater philosophy of history, but it worked out really well.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-5501334112404323475?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Many people confuse empathy and sympathy.  Empathy doesn&amp;#8217;t mean sharing someone&amp;#8217;s feelings, or having pity on them; it means recognizing that they have feelings (and motivations, assumptions, fears, etc) and that they are, in fact, humans and not objects.  As such, empathy is fundamental to any human interaction, unless it&amp;#8217;s some inhuman, brutal force of power where one treats another as an object.  Maybe one aspect of severe autism is that those children don&amp;#8217;t have empathy, and so can&amp;#8217;t understand and interact with other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, if historians are studying people, real human beings, they need to have empathy for their subject.  Historians need to&amp;#8212;as much as possible&amp;#8212;understand who those people were inside, what motivated the behaviors under examination.  Figuring out the reasons for events requires empathy, and provides coherence and significance to the description of those events.  If a historian somehow managed to study an era without empathy for it, the write up would be a list of random, disconnected impressions that create confusion instead of clarity.  That&amp;#8217;s not history.  Statistics, maybe, but not history.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-4863153968537195795?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

Not being much of a philosopher myself, or being someone who cares for the subject, I&amp;#8217;m not completely certain what to make of this book.  I really enjoyed the first half of the book in which he discusses the public nature of penance and the ways in which it was imposed on the body (largely because the idea of the &amp;#8220;public&amp;#8221; and corporeal history are two fields that greatly interest me), but after that, around halfway through, I felt as though Foucault really lost his grounding in history and the philosophy took over.  At times, it felt more like he was simply creating points for his argument rather than basing them in actual fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a strong thread in the book, especially in the second half in which he discusses private penance in the penitentiaries, in which Foucault really seems to almost prefer the public, body-based penance.  In discussing his antipathy toward newer forms of societal discipline, I think he goes too far in equating the soul-based, regimented penance of prisons with, for instance, reforms in the public schools (educational issues are a topic for a different post).  Nevertheless, his assertion that private punishment was primarily a deterrent toward others considering committing the same crime rather than an actual chastisement for the offender is interesting; however, I think the same could apply to public body-based punishment as well.  Similarly, toward the end of the book Foucault discusses ways in which the new types of penance are centered in the hands of the state.  However, discipline had always been a part of the state, in the sense that it was in the purview of the king, as Foucault notes.  Additionally, in the pre-modern era, church and state were not separated in the way that they are today; thus, ecclesiastical punishments carried out by the Inquisition can be considered a type of state-based discipline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, there were parts of this week&amp;#8217;s reading that I enjoyed and parts with which I disagreed.

                                &lt;p&gt;I think empathy is certainly required of the historian, as it relates to the cultural relativism of anthropology.  The historian cannot become a participant-observer of the past, but I think it is her/his duty to be sensitive to ideals/thoughts/realities of the past.  As historians, we attempt to understand the past society that we study as much as possible; only then can we begin our studies.  As Sahlins pointed out in his article, there are some tribal groups in which societal knowledge and history is absorbed by the tribal leader.  Without understanding that, or by association the ways in which past societies functioned, we miss a key point about that period/group, and we are unable to do relevant history about it.  We risk projecting our modern, western views, morals, and norms onto another group for which they would be alien.  That being said, our work is grounded in documents and evidence.  Thus, the understanding and empathy that historians espouse should be rooted in what we can know or discern about a society, not what we imagine for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve purposefully avoided the phrase &amp;#8220;a culture&amp;#8221; in the above paragraph, so that the idea of culture could be addressed here.  I think culture is the evolving intellectual construct by which societies operate&amp;#8212;intellectual and not also physical, because we discussed in class Monday, and as found in Geertz, an eye twitch is an eye twitch.  It is how we consciously react to the twitch that gives it relevant meanings.  I don&amp;#8217;t believe that culture is most significant object of historical inquiry, but it is certainly an indispensable one.  With it, we can attempt to make sense of historical actors and actions, but there are other considerations.  As James Wilson noted in his post, the importance given to culture depends on what we find in the documentary evidence.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6220711600267285330-9139317032507289948?l=jawhite21.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;In many respects, empathy is a polarizing concept similar to objectivity—it is either a goal to be sought or a mental construct which can cloud historians&amp;#8217; judgment of the evidence.  To be sure, the latter is quite plausible, and most historians would agree that identifying too closely with peoples under investigation is a danger.  Improperly used, empathy can tend towards simple imagination and perhaps even counterfactual flights of fancy.  It can also tend toward over-identification with historical actors.  Though it may be admirable and entirely warranted in certain instances, over-empathizing can cause sympathy for historical actors, which is an obvious threat to the historian&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, historical empathy offers a way to recognize the differentness of the past, and to understand the variety of perspectives held by historical actors.  In this sense, empathy offers a window to understanding the question of why historical groups or figures acted the way they did.  In situations with minimal or contradictory evidence, empathy could be a useful tool because it brings historical events away from theoretical constructs or dispassionate words on a source document and places it back in human scale.  In certain instances, then, empathy is a useful tool in abductive reasoning (which is much better way of describing what is otherwise historical&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;guesswork&amp;#8221;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empathy thus has its pros and cons, but which side is the historian to take in the discussion?  Perhaps the safest answer is to say that empathy is a useful tool to be used in moderation.  The greatest benefit of empathy is its ability to bring the story of history back to the human level so that readers may better understand the past.  Empathy also permits the historian to frame research in useful ways when sources are problematic.  Over-indulgence, however, is to be avoided as it may diminish the effectiveness of professional research. &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this framework, understanding culture is an important part of understanding the past.  Defining culture then is a key to understanding the past.  Culture seems to be the intellectual framework within which a given society operates.  Understanding culture, then, creates a lens through which we may view the events of a given time relative to their setting and actors.  As historians, it allows us to make connections between events, people, places, movements, and ideas which may not otherwise be evident.  Culture, however, is not necessarily the most important factor in understanding the history of a given time or place; culture&amp;#8217;s importance depends on what the evidence&amp;nbsp;shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tangentially related then, is the difference between history and anthropology: anthropology, at its most basic is a search for definitions, to define the human condition; at its root, history is search to answer questions of why events played out as they did.  To be sure, there is a sense of cultural relativism which comes with connecting past events to the society which brought them about.  As historians, however, we are bound by a sense of evidentiary relativism which compels us to form our judgments according to what the sources tell us.  Cultural relativism can be used to complete the picture, so to speak, but as professionals we are tied to our&amp;nbsp;sources.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m curious, given the truncated nature of our discussion on Monday, where you all stand now on the question, &amp;#8220;Does a historian need empathy to understand the past?&amp;#8221; If we continue pushing the notion that the past is a foreign country, the historian has no opportunity to become a participant observer of that past. But, does the historian have the obligation, or at least should the historian have the obligation to approach that past culture with the anthropologist&amp;#8217;s cultural&amp;nbsp;relativism? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, is &amp;#8220;culture&amp;#8221;, and however &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; define that term, an indispensable object of historical inquiry? Is it the most significant? How do you define&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;I very much enjoyed this extract as Clifford Geertz uses  his study of Moroccan culture at the time of French occupation to explain the very core of anthropology because I have done past research into French occupation of Morocco, it really touched a good cord with me.  Anthropology as a school of thought has great merits to be exploited by historians,and in my view should aid me in understanding Medieval Spain or Morocco for that matter.   But like all schools of thought it has shortcomings, as a historian I always struggle with generalizations, however I enjoy the social norms they set as cultural standards as they make historical interpretations&amp;nbsp;easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed Geertz&amp;#8217; synthesis of anthropology as a school of thought that busies itself with the same &amp;#8220;realities that others-historians, economists, political scientists, sociologists- confront in more fateful settings: Power, Change, Faith, Oppression, Work, Passion, Authority, Beauty, Violence, Love, Prestige&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; but the anthropologist concerns himself with taking &amp;#8220;the capital letters off&amp;nbsp;them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning the Book Barber and Berdam, &lt;em&gt;The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror&lt;/em&gt;. Tucson: Univ. of Arizona Press, 1998, I thought it was a fantastic intro into anthropology and ethno-history, and I particularly enjoyed ethno-history as it combined Anthropological approach and history into one as I had discussed&amp;nbsp;earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror&lt;/span&gt; was an interesting read.  It was much more like an instruction manual than I had anticipated, and I think it would have been well suited to an undergrad methods course.  At the same time, I see its benefit for giving us an overview of what ethnohistory is.  I appreciated the long methods section because I think many of the techniques would be relevant to any historian, not just those undertaking ethnohistory itself.  As a medievalist, I&amp;#8217;ll certainly have to do my share of paleography, and even though there are certainly more advanced/specialized books out there for medieval paleography, this was a nice introductory overview of some concerns to be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reality-mediation model, as I understand it, seems such a straightforward idea that it&amp;#8217;s surprising that no one had articulated it before.  Or, perhaps, it was just such a common tenet that no one felt the need to actually write it out before this book.  As I see it, the model states that authors, either consciously or unconsciously, modulate reality/the Truth when they create documents.  Perhaps by purposefully leaving out or altering information or perhaps by subconsciously not noticing the importance of an event, an author&amp;#8217;s record of events does not exactly equate with what happened.  As we discussed last week, this shows up in inaccurate eyewitness testimonies of crime scenes today.  As historians, we must be careful when reading primary documents to tease out any biases from the author, and to avoid, as much as possible, mediating the reality, however altered it may already be, found in the primary source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geertz&amp;#8217;s article emphasized the public nature of culture and the importance of thick description and emergence into a society to understand its culture, as a way of explaining anthropology.  The wink/twitch example was really helpful to latch onto throughout the article.  Sahlins asserts that anthropology and history, even though they sometimes reach different conclusions and have different methods, can be used to inform each other.  I liked his example that for some tribes, the &amp;#8220;history of the leader&amp;#8221; approach isn&amp;#8217;t as outdated as we tend to universally think it is.  For some groups, the tribal identity is subsumed into the knowledge and person of the leader; thus, a chronicle of the chieftain &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a chronicle of the tribe, at least from the internal perspective of the group under study.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6220711600267285330-4161440939136946577?l=jawhite21.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Barber and Berdan&amp;#8217;s The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror is a book that I thoroughly enjoyed reading. I spent a semester as an Anthropology major at Tulane, after my year-long foray into Theatre and before I made the final switch to History, so I enjoyed reading about ethnohistory as a discipline—the combination of anthropology and history (yes, yes, I know it can be a combo of a dozen other things too) was one that felt relatively comfortable to me, even though my anthropology background is now six years behind me. Wow. I&amp;#8217;m feeling a little old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first part of this book, while overly basic, was actually very helpful to me. From what I can tell, this is really an introduction to the field, the kind of thing you would use as a textbook in an introductory ethnohistory class, but, frankly, that made it more valuable. My anthro skills are rusty, so having them refreshed was nice, and the terminology used helped me continue fleshing out my own identity as a historian. I didn&amp;#8217;t need primary and secondary sources redefined for me, but the terms they used afterwards… well, I&amp;#8217;m apparently more interested in personal influence than social forces, though I recognize the value of the latter and use it quite a bit; I think I&amp;#8217;m also a bit of an ideationalist, though that might just be a backlash at three weeks of materialism—I still understand and value materialism, but I like the concept that human behavior is primarily shaped by ideas, ideologies, and values. Maybe I&amp;#8217;m just naïve. That&amp;#8217;s always a possibility. I&amp;#8217;m also very much a believer in the conflict theory of human interactions, though this is not always the case, and I am very much a stochastic. I&amp;#8217;m so glad that word exists and that I know it now. Chance, chaos theory, random happenstance—oh yeah, that definitely has a role in history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second section wasn&amp;#8217;t quite as useful personally, though I like that it is a reminder of the wide variety of sources that we can and should use. Obviously, historians know that documents have to be looked at carefully because of bias and what-not, but the number of methods and source types they look at was a good little refresher. The paleography section in particular I enjoyed, as I am really excited for the year-long paleography/history of the book course next year with Drs. Burman and Lafferty. The reminder than pictographs, glyphs, runes, hieroglyphs, etc. are all writing styles, the brief description of ways of writing, the number and abbreviation segments—I&amp;#8217;m going to learn a lot more about all of these, and this section pretty much wet my whistle. The calendrics bit was my favorite, I think—I&amp;#8217;m doing my capstone fro Marco on Anglo-Saxon England, and the debate over the dating of Easter is pretty important in the whole Celtic v. Roman Christianity debate, so a section on the use of calendar and dating systems, and what they can tell us about both history and a people&amp;#8217;s culture was a nice reminder. Linguistics, toponymy, source analysis, etc. were all nice, but they kept reminding me that this really is an introductory book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book will definitely be something I keep in mind when I start teaching—I think it could be great for an undergraduate course, like an Intro. to Historical Study or something like that—the chapters are useful introductions to the use of a variety of sources, the appendixes were fun, and the bibliography had a number of texts I want to check out later. It was pretty basic, though, so I was hoping for something a bit more in depth when I turned to the articles. Also, I have to admit that I didn&amp;#8217;t see how different ethnohistory was from the kinds of work I already try to do; maybe that means I&amp;#8217;m just doing a better job than I thought, or maybe I just missed the point—I don&amp;#8217;t think so, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Other Times, Other Customs&amp;#8221; by Marshall Sahlin, an article on the anthropology of history, is a lovely little piece, which begins by reconciling cultural/social history with political history, arguing that the political history of kings, the so-called &amp;#8220;big man theory,&amp;#8221; only works out because of the cultural construction that gives them so much power, allowing them &amp;#8220;a disproportionate historical effect.&amp;#8221; I thought this was a neat little argument. He also argues essentially that heroic figures and kings are social constructs, that even if they do exist they are really markers of cultural concerns and interests, given power in order to represent specific things to the culture they come out of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sahlin looks at a wide variety of cultures to construct his arguments, mostly Pacific Islanders compared to the Western world—Fijians and the Myceneans, Maori and the Greeks, interactions between the islanders and colonizing powers, etc. His final argument is in favor of a historical anthropology, essentially ethnohistory, but with an anthropological focus rather than a historical one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other article, the first chapter of Clifford Geertz&amp;#8217;s The Interpretation of Cultures, looks at culture as &amp;#8220;webs of significance&amp;#8221; around man, and Geertz attempts to construct a way of looking at the meanings of culture beneath their enigmatic surfaces. He discusses the basics of anthropology in this section, which was a useful refresher of my Intro. to Anthropology class from my freshman year. He discusses what ethnography is, and argues that it is less observational and more interpretive, regardless of what people might believe, and that analysis, therefore, is a very important part of what anthropologists do. He defines culture as what people do, and sees behavior as a symbolic act, arguing that the only important question as a result is &amp;#8220;what their import is,&amp;#8221; what any act of culture says about the group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His mention of cognitive anthropology brought up unpleasant memories of the class that caused me to drop the Anthro major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geertz&amp;#8217;s article, to me, was more helpful than Sahlin&amp;#8217;s. I like in Sahlin&amp;#8217;s that he uses a wide variety of cultures from different areas, but otherwise the article did very little for me. Geertz&amp;#8217;s article was a refresher course, on the other hand, and reminded me a number of things I used to know about anthropology. I think anthro. is a very useful tool for a historian, and I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to this week&amp;#8217;s discussion.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-2970167261381314840?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror: Understanding Cultures through Primary Sources was an incredibly helpful and accessible book focusing on ethnohistory, particularly, and historiography, generally. It was in many ways a how-to-guide for beginning historians, detailing methods, theories, and possible pitfalls that those in the field would benefit from being familiar with. It introduced various ethnohistorical terms, particularly in part I: &amp;#8220;Concepts,&amp;#8221; although definitions were sprinkled through the next two sections, as well. The Concepts chapter established the theories to be occasionally referred to in the rest of the book (such as various assumptions and the use of models). It goes through the changing definitions of ethnohistory and finally settles on &amp;#8220;an interdisciplinary field that studies past human behavior and is characterized by a primary reliance on documents, the use of input from other sources when available, a methodology that incorporates historiography and cultural relativism, and a focus on cultural&amp;nbsp;interaction&amp;#8221;(12). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section also defines different approaches and philosophies behind ethnohistory and explains the importance of models to clarify ideas. Some opposing approaches are emic vs. etic(using the world-view of the subject or the historian as the basis for analysis), particularist vs, nomothetic(using specific case studies or looking at broad, generalities), or personal influence vs. social forces as the chief determinant of individual actions or events(16-17). After this, it examines particular assumptions that some ethnohistorians make, also in diametric pairings. Ideationalist vs. materialist and conflict vs. consensus are two examples of assumptions used to explain the supposed driving forces behind all human actions(19).  The final section of the book, &amp;#8220;Strategies&amp;#8221; summed up the practical application component of this book as a directive for successful research topics. Barber and Berdan manage to offer their suggestions delicately, carefully qualifying their findings as possibilities for other scholars to&amp;nbsp;consider. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Methods section, which makes up the bulk of the book was the most engaging for me, personally. While the other two sections were certainly helpful, this section was filled with not only recommendations for scholarship but also intriguing examples. The case studies at the end of the chapters were applied well to the topics previously discussed, but I thought the examples given in the rest of the text were actually the most enlightening, some examples of which I have decided to mention: The complex nature of pictographs was clearly exhibited, as was the varying nature of alphabetized language(53-66). I really enjoyed the sections on spelling, names, spellings, and calendars. I was fascinated to discover that ten days were removed from history and that the ten days were different in various places due to the centuries it took to convert all of Europe to the Gregorian calendar (October 5-14, 1582 according to the Pope, December 10-19, 1582 in Paris, France, not until the 18th century in America, pages 82, 86).  I similarly had no idea that many of the spelling changes that differentiate American and English spellings can be traced back to the decisions of one individual, Noah Webster. I had also often thought that certain spellings clearly favor some dialects over others (for example, based on my Rochesterian accent, I always want to spell emperor &amp;#8220;emporer&amp;#8221;), but it was interesting to see this validated in this book, as Barber and Berdan note of the language codification efforts of the William Caxton in 1476 who admittedly chose the London accent as his&amp;nbsp;base(67). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source Analysis was also a helpful part of this book, detailing not only physical and content analysis for spotting forgeries, but also for designating a source&amp;#8217;s value. This was followed by discussion on the benefits, possible pitfalls, and methods of quantitative analysis, then visual sources, with maps in its own chapter. Then, in a fitting final chapter of this section, the book discusses recognizing complementary sources and combining one&amp;#8217;s analysis to utilize both.  As mentioned before, the examples used throughout this section made it more enjoyable for me to read and made historical study seem once again like an exciting pursuit, not just a daunting&amp;nbsp;task. &lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror&lt;/em&gt;, Barber &lt;span class=&#34;amp&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Berdan | &amp;#8220;Thick Description,&amp;#8221; Geertz | &amp;#8220;Other Times, Other Customs,&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;Sahlins&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror&lt;/em&gt; presented as a good introduction to the field of ethnohistory.  From an operational definition of ethnohistory as an &amp;#8220;interdisciplinary field that studies past human behavior and is characterized by a primary reliance on documents, the use of  from other sources when available, a methodology that incorporates historiography and cultural relativism, and a focus on cultural interaction,&amp;#8221; the authors set about to explain the intricacies of field&amp;#8217;s methodologies and basic assumptions.  Interestingly, the authors seemingly reject the established methodologies for their own construct of &amp;#8220;reality-mediation&amp;#8221; in which sources are viewed as texts that mediate and simultaneously distort the external realities they record.  Within this framework, therefore, it is the historian&amp;#8217;s task to describe the external reality as presented by sources and to explain the effect of the sources&amp;#8217; innate perspectival inadequacies.  On the whole, the book was interesting, though I often found the authors&amp;#8217; literary style lacking.  It is an excellent introductory textbook for exploring&amp;nbsp;ethnohistory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Thick Description&amp;#8221; by Geertz expressed much the same sentiment.  According to him, ethnography is a field of interpretation—it assumes that &amp;#8220;culture is composed of psychological structures by means of which individuals or groups of individuals guide their behavior&amp;#8221; (11).  Because &amp;#8220;culture is a context,&amp;#8221; an unengaged objective point of view is removed from reality as the details needed to &amp;#8220;comprehend a particular event, ritual, custom, idea, or whatever, is insinuated as background information before the thing itself is directly examined&amp;#8221; by the source or observer (13, 9).  At its essence, then, ethnography is simply an attempt to understand&amp;nbsp;culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sahlins&amp;#8217; &amp;#8220;Other Times, Other Cultures&amp;#8221; sets out to prove a rather simple point that &amp;#8220;different cultural orders have their own modes of historical action, consciousness, and determination—their own historical practice&amp;#8221; (518).  In establishing an investigatory framework, the author argues that &amp;#8220;history is culturally constructed from the bottom up &amp;#8230; [and is based on] the prevailing inclinations of the people in general&amp;#8221; (517).  History, therefore, is a given culture&amp;#8217;s hybridized consensus of its participants&amp;#8217; individual actions. The author sets about supporting his position through several very complicated discussions, however, and I fear that I may have misjudged the impact of his&amp;nbsp;argument.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Unlike several of the books that have been assigned this semester, I found that I could offer no real complaints about &lt;i&gt;The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror. &lt;/i&gt;I felt this was an extremely well-done book that provided a great deal of useful information in a stylistically enjoyable manner. Although much of what the book contained was not necessarily new information, it was nonetheless useful to have some basic methodological approaches clarified and expanded upon. Many of the points Barber and Berdan brought up were, for me at least, familiar considerations that had been introduced since I began my historical training in undergraduate college. Regardless of any former acquaintance with these foundational factors, I still found it enlightening to have issues such as the influence of background, complications with evidence, and basic research methods directly addressed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Reading this book was particularly interesting following Peter Novick&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;That Noble Dream&lt;/i&gt;. Ethnohistory as put forth in &lt;i&gt;The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror&lt;/i&gt; seemed to assume that objectivity is an impossible goal, although Barber and Berdan would not consider objectivity to be a desirable end in the first place. I have always been a little uncertain as to the exact definition of ethnohistory, and this book did a great deal toward clarifying some of the questions I had regarding this new approach. Personally, I felt that the differences between history and ethnohistory were quite subtle; as a historian, I am still not sure I entirely agree with ethnohisory&amp;#8217;s identity as a completely separate phenomenon from historical study. It seemed that ethnohistory&amp;#8217;s methodological approach would work well as a sub-area of the historical profession as well, although I am sure the same argument could be made for incorporating it into anthropology just as there is a valid argument for its independent existence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;I found myself agreeing with much of what Barber and Berdan defined as ethnohistory, particularly in relation to the goal of ethnohistory. Relativism has a much-respected place within this methodological approach, as I believe appropriate when attempting to study the interaction of different societies in the distant past. I especially enjoyed the distinction that ethnohistorians were attempting to provide a medium through which the past could be viewed, to create an understandable discourse with the past that allows modern readers access to a completely different world. As the authors stressed, ethnohistory embraces a multiplicity of interpretations rather than seeking a universal, or even generally consensual, explanation. &lt;i&gt;The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror&lt;/i&gt; does a good job at providing a convincing argument for the existence of and acceptance of this diversity. As almost all historians acknowledge, the background and experience of individual authors necessarily affect their perception of historical events. Although evidentiary differentiations are just as important when explaining the past, this factor does not often receive the same degree of attention. I felt that the extensive treatment Barber and Berdan devoted to highlighting the many possible interpretations the same piece of evidence could have, for both contemporaries and modern historians, to be one of the most useful and interesting parts of the books. I believe most historians are aware of evidentiary complications, but personally I will be much more conscious of such difficulties than I was prior to reading this book.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Geertz&amp;#8217;s excerpt likewise dealt with the emergence of ethnohistory as a methodological approach. Geertz&amp;#8217;s work was a more theoretical piece than &lt;i&gt;The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror &lt;/i&gt;and focused on the idea of providing &amp;#8220;thick description,&amp;#8221; where thick description provides for the subtle meanings societies attribute to actions according to cultural norms. Ethnohistory as described by Geertz seemed to resemble anthropology more strongly than the historical tinge it had in Barber and Berdan&amp;#8217;s book, which doubtless contributed to his emphasis on the interpretation of culture. According to Geertz, culture is a public phenomenon that provides the framework against which meaning is attributed. I found Geertz&amp;#8217;s example of the wink versus twitch to be particularly enlightening. Another interesting point was his assertion that ethnohistorians should attempt to capture the individuality of cultures while still exposing &amp;#8220;normalness,&amp;#8221; or general patterns. Drawing this distinction reminded me of an earlier week&amp;#8217;s debate on the validity of grand theories as opposed to localized studies, which we likewise concluded was best solved by a compromise between the two. Although the reading for this week did not strictly deal with the historical profession, I still found them to be some of the most interesting and helpful works so far. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-854536317588722060?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Within ethnography and historical anthropology are found some intriguing ideas about and approaches toward the gathering of historical knowledge. And the writers named above attempt, with varying degrees of success, to explain those ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the three works, I found Sahlins&amp;#8217; &amp;#8220;Other Times, Other Customs: The Anthropology of History&amp;#8221; to be by far the least accessible. I see and understand the thesis provided on Page 518, there are some interesting historical tidbits scattered throughout, and yet I still had a difficult time discerning the manner in which all of it fits together to illustrate the point the writer is trying to make in this short but still rather prolix essay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To a lesser extent, Geertz&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture&amp;#8221; also suffers from a lack of tight focus. I understand the concept of, and have in fact practiced, thick description. Still, I found it difficult to follow the writer&amp;#8217;s train of thought, insofar as all included concepts interrelate. On the other hand, the essay was enlivened by several engaging passages, such as these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;(W)hat we call our data are really our own constructions of other people&amp;#8217;s constructions of what they and their compatriots are up&amp;nbsp;to.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;(C)ulture [is located] in the minds and hearts of men&amp;#8221; (quote from Ward&amp;nbsp;Goodenough).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Understanding a people&amp;#8217;s culture exposed their normalness without reducing their&amp;nbsp;particularity.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;(I)t is not necessary to know everything in order to understand&amp;nbsp;something.&amp;#8221; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Cultural analysis is intrinsically incomplete. And, worse than that, the more deeply it goes, the less complete it&amp;nbsp;is.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dquo&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;(I)f you want to understand what a science is, … you should look at what the practitioners of it&amp;nbsp;do.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This latter gem encapsulates a sentiment also found in Barber and Berdan&amp;#8217;s book, &amp;#8220;The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror: Understanding Cultures Through Primary Sources.&amp;#8221; Comprising an exhaustive look at the work of ethnohistorians, this work at the same time is wholly engaging and accessible; therefore, it was the reading I enjoyed most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the information regarding concepts and strategies was informative and well-presented, my favorite aspect was Part 2, which dealt with methods. More specifically still, as someone with interests in language and genealogy, I was engrossed by the chapters on paleography and interpretation of names. (As an aside, though, I am a lifelong Southerner, and my family&amp;#8217;s roots in this region stretch back some 300 years; still, I have never known anyone named &amp;#8220;Bobby Don&amp;#8221; [Page 136]). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I feel that Barber and Berdan succeed especially well in making clear the basics of their discipline.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8399157107533224051-1165270429839885982?l=bumpusjournal.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Our readings for this week were &lt;em&gt;Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture&lt;/em&gt;, by Clifford Geertz, &lt;em&gt;Other Customs&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Anthropology of History&lt;/em&gt;, by Marshall Sahlins,&amp;nbsp;and &lt;u&gt;The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror&lt;/u&gt;, by Russel Barber and Frances Berdan.&amp;nbsp; These readings give an interesting view of the contemporary thought on what it means to &lt;em&gt;do anthropology&lt;/em&gt;, and some&amp;nbsp;time-honored practices to aid in the&amp;nbsp;practice of anthropology and ethnohistory.&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror&lt;/u&gt;, published in 1988, offers is set up like an instructionl manual for performing ethnohistory, and many of the tips and sundry case studies could also easily cross over to the study of history.&amp;nbsp; The book offers many&amp;nbsp;avenues of approach for dealing with primary sources&amp;nbsp;with the purpose of performing a&amp;nbsp;micro to macro style historical research which is&amp;nbsp;where it derives its ethnographic influence.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Anthropology of History, &lt;/em&gt;published in 1983, also stresses this micro to macro method of doing history.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#8220;The idea is that history is culturally constructed from the bottom up: as the precipitate, in social institutions and outcomes, of the prevailing inclinations of the people in general,&amp;#8221; (pg 517).&amp;nbsp; With this in mind this essay also stresses that the historian always be mindful that earch culture has its own mode of historical activity and its own historical consciousness that may look very different from our own.&amp;nbsp; The idea of &lt;em&gt;Heroic History &lt;/em&gt;in many cultures is used as an example, as it varies in form from the European idea that the &amp;#8220;theory of history is that social outcomes are the cumulative expressions of individual actions,&amp;#8221; (pg525).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thick Description&lt;/em&gt;, first published in 1973,&amp;nbsp;contends that many old anthropological notions,&amp;nbsp;such as Skinnerian behaviorism, objectivism and operationalism&amp;nbsp;are no longer viable in ethnography.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#8216;Thick description&amp;#8217; is instead an attempt at proper interpretation of the symbols that every culture uses in order to discover the context behing a subject&amp;#8217;s actions.&amp;nbsp; Conversely, the objective detailing of a person or cultures actions with no regard to their context if &amp;#8216;thin description.&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp; Ultimately, Geertz asserts,&amp;nbsp;ethnography is, at its heart, an interpretive activity, and not an observational one, because things &amp;#8220;we call our data are really our own constructions of other people&amp;#8217;s constructions of what they and their compatriots are up to.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp; &amp;#8220;Most of what we need to comprehend a particular event, ritual, custom, idea, or whatever is insinuated as background information before the thing itself is directly examined,&amp;#8221; (pg 9).&amp;nbsp; So, beyond the good practices of&amp;nbsp;observation and dilligence in collecting information required by the historian as well as the ethnographer, it is also crucial that the researcher becomes very skilled in the art of cultural interpretation as well.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8880139849602883287-3530980209338142427?l=dixonro.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;As an introduction to  a subject, this book felt like a hand book nearly to the point of distraction by monotony. However, given what they were attempting to do it  seems to require a systematic approach. However, it seems like the primary difference between this and a potential handbook for historical studies is merely one of interest. History, it seems,  has become a polyglot and has absorbed in many ways culture, literature, art, and archeology. It felt a little like Barber and Berdan through  &amp;#8221;Ethnohistory&amp;#8221; was either attempting to do the same thing or were simply applying historical methods to a new set of criteria. Many of the examples  of &amp;#8220;ethnohisotry&amp;#8221; seem to include references either to non-native records of native doings (either in an imperial or exploratory setting) or of native records that through imperialism or nativization has lost some manner of native connection to the past. In one sense, Ethnohistory appears to be searching for precisely the type of history that is the hardest, using historical methods to come up with archeological or anthropological conclusions. In essence, it is searching for something which historians use but do not necessarily concentrate on: human &amp;#8220;behavior&amp;#8221; (taken from Barber and Berdan&amp;#8217;s definition) which seems like a strange sub-group of history and something which seems only technically differentiated from the larger&amp;nbsp;group.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Here are a few questions to ponder before tomorrow&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;class&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q#  1: In Chapter one, as Barber and Berdan begin to define ethnography and explain it&amp;#8217;s methodology, in what ways if at all does it differ from our definition of history or (more importantly) in its&amp;nbsp;methodology?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q# 2: What is an eitlogue? (pg 37) How does it relate to the Reality-mediation model? What are the four ways in which Mediation effects the &amp;#8220;true&amp;#8221; communication of stimuli? (pg&amp;nbsp;39)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q#3: In what sense does Barber and Berdan use &amp;#8220;deconstruction&amp;#8221;? Given the goals of this book, is this a choice?&amp;nbsp;(44)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q#4: What are some of the issues one must consider when engaging in&amp;nbsp;Paleography?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q#5: What factors go into the creation of a calendar and how do these determine how &amp;#8220;time&amp;#8221; is conceived by various&amp;nbsp;cultures?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q#6: What are some of the more nuanced properties, functions, or practices in language and how does this make translation difficult? Why do you think Poetry is considered more difficult to translate than &amp;#8220;regular&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;prose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#7: What can place names tell us? (120-125) What can an individual&amp;#8217;s name tell us about them and how can this be&amp;nbsp;confusing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;# 8: What are the internal and External Methods of Textual analysis?  What relationships must an author have in relation to an event they are reporting on to be considered not only authentic but authoritative?(Chapter&amp;nbsp;7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#9: What are the potential pitfalls of quantitative analysis? What can be gained by&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#10: In what ways are visual and textual analyses similar/ different? When describing the uses of visual media and the pitfalls in interpretation of these media, could many of the same principals apply to both written word and pictorial&amp;nbsp;art?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#11: In what ways Is the study of Maps complicated by the fact that they are representations of a reality? In what ways are these complications tied to complications in textual or visual&amp;nbsp;interpretations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#12: What are the problems with using &amp;#8220;oral accounts&amp;#8221; as sources? Why do Barber and Berdan conclude that textual sources are&amp;nbsp;better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;Mirror, Mirror, what can I see?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;&amp;#8220;The Emperor&amp;#8217;s Mirror&amp;#8221; is a deep book.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Lots of info about categorizing, analyzing, alphabetizing; if it could be zing-ed, it was covered.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I found every bit of it quite interesting and informative.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I wish this book had been assigned in my undergrad days as part of the honors research program as we went over a lot of the same material but through different books and the instructor explaining these processes to us.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This one book put it all in one place.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I especially loved chapter 12.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Research design, or lack thereof, could make or break you as you push toward your goals.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This gave me much to ponder and it follows a lot of what we are pursuing in this class currently.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Finding a valid topic, getting a list of reading together, making a plan of how it fits, methods to use, things to watch out for, it is all very helpful to me.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Chapter 13 as well, &lt;i style=&#34;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&#34;&gt;Working in Archives and Elsewhere&lt;/i&gt; was quite helpful.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It is always important to remember that you can&amp;#8217;t just &amp;#8220;Google&amp;#8221; everything.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Research has to involve going through archives, and talking with the archivist as some holdings are not listed in catalogs, but the curator knows they are there.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The last thing anyone would want to do is research something that has already been researched.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This is definitely a book I will keep to reference often as I proceed in historical research.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;Thick Description&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;The excerpt &lt;i style=&#34;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&#34;&gt;Thick Description&lt;/i&gt; opens with a quick speech on trying to define culture.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Then, we get inundated with possible meanings and variations of what a wink/twitch could mean based on concepts of what our culture construes as a wink/twitch.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;However, we did learn that this sorting out what it could mean is what ethnography is. (7) We also find that it is note-taking about what the ethnographer sees; this by his recounting of the sheep incident in Morocco, where we learn that identifying established codes is also important. (9) We get a decent overview of what culture is, and a little of what it is not – power.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;We learn that in the end, the ethnographer studying a culture is only writing what he sees, analyzing those views, and not predicting anything from it only adding to the general knowledge about a certain people and their culture.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;Other Times….&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;Marshall Sahlins started well wanting to support the idea of a &amp;#8220;life of communities&amp;#8221; (517) as opposed to an elite history.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It got murky when he began the heroic history section, but I tried to keep up.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;With a history tied to kings it seemed a bit elitist, but I believe the point was the people saw their lives as tied to their king – the &amp;#8220;cultural order&amp;#8221; he called it. (520) That would explain why it is so hard to get a picture of regular people in ancient societies; their understanding of self was as a subordinate to those in charge.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Once he started with the New Zealand war of the Maori, I was almost totally lost.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The best I could come up with was that he was applying anthropological information to see the history of a people in a new light – one where the people constantly relive the heroic leader history of their society, just with new players.&lt;/div&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This book was exceptionally clear and well organized, with lists, and definitions, and everything a control freak with a short attention span could want.  It was liberally sprinkled with clever language and very elementary concepts.  It should have been a very quick read.  But, it was stuffed full of topics that reminded me of various events and situations throughout my life.  The margins of my copy are full of references to these, and most of them I didn&amp;#8217;t write down.  The entire time I spent reading this book, I was visiting classes I&amp;#8217;ve taught or taken, books I&amp;#8217;ve read, jobs I&amp;#8217;ve had, my grandma&amp;#8217;s kitchen, trips I&amp;#8217;ve gone on, and so on.  So, while it&amp;#8217;s obvious that this book is a great overview of and introductions to the field of ethno-history, with extensive references cited for further study, it&amp;#8217;s much less obvious that it also makes a fabulous memory jogger.  Apparently, I&amp;#8217;ve been living as an ethno-historian without realizing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In between mental field trips, I enjoyed the book for its own sake as well.  A lot of the information was stuff I&amp;#8217;ve either learned or figured out long ago, but in between such momentous revelations like the difference between primary and secondary sources (memory of teaching third grade) were little tidbits like why people were so fond of brown ink long ago (59) which I&amp;#8217;d often wondered about but never looked up, and a handy chart of when different places converted to the Gregorian calendar (86).  I love it when my procrastination is rewarded like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate their structure of giving just a general, introductory orientation of each subject area, and then referring to more complete sources.  This enabled them to cover a lot of ground in a manageable volume, and to provide a very positive introduction for potential colleagues or supporters (like we discussed in class last week about the dangers of becoming obscure and then extraneous).  I found myself thinking several times that this would be a great handbook for public school teachers, because they touch on so many topics that get covered in school, in such an accessible manner.  Even the chapters I expected to dislike (calendars and maps) ended up being interesting, possibly because I knew the least about them before reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wonder, though, how ethno-history, as per the definition on page 12, differs from just plain history.  Is it only in that last phrase, about cultural interaction?  Because the rest of it is pretty much what I think of as history.  Am I in LaLa Land again?  What am I missing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#8220;Thick Description&amp;#8221; chapter was interesting and informative, but—probably because of the on-screen format—my notes are a list of random bits, like a magpie took them.  I noted several observations about what constitutes culture, and what ethnographers do.  The clearest analogy for me was comparing ethnography to diagnosing a patient.  You need some expectations and experiences as a frame of reference (sort of like the research design from Barber and Berdan) but you mostly focus on what&amp;#8217;s in front of you, fighting all the while against coloring your observations by those expectations and references.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Other Times, Other Customs&amp;#8221; was a slog.  Either I was just too tired, or the screen aspect overcame me, or it was poorly written, but I did not tease out a main point that tied it together and gave it a reason for being written.  The last page finally said, &amp;#8220;Anthropologists rise from the abstract structure to the explication of the concrete event.&amp;#8221; (534)  This was interesting and well said, but I missed what the Fiji and Maori stories had to do with it.  I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to discussion, and hoping we&amp;#8217;re about done with pdf&amp;#8217;s.  Although, I read plenty of them for my annotated bibliography and didn&amp;#8217;t struggle…hmm, I&amp;#8217;m leaning toward door number three now.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-8380919064898243132?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Firstly, there is nothing more depressing for me than this quote: &amp;#8220;it was not unusual for a bright young man to become\a full professor within a few years of receiving the doctorate, and to achieve national eminence before he was out of his thirties.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
over all, it seems like about half of the content of this book could be considered merely a collection of relatively minor incidents surrounded intentionally with a quality batch of witty quotes; that is not to say there isn&amp;#8217;t much to be gained from this book,but it meanders more than it must.&lt;br /&gt;
Most Interesting to me in this book is the discussion of &amp;#8220;relativism&amp;#8221;; Novick, at one pint asks, &amp;#8220;But what if authority ceased to be consesnual&amp;#8221;?What is interesting is that the myriad of possible answers. There are those who subscribe to schools, which are internally relative to some work or collection of works on a theoretical level even if the standard is used with much variation. There are those who retreating history to making technical arguments surrounded by a larger review of the schools or individuals mention. Indeed, how Novick traces &amp;#8220;relativism&amp;#8221; is to my tastes the most interesting discussion in te whole&amp;nbsp;book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tied to this discussion is Novick&amp;#8217;s discussion of personality/ political leanings/ and personal &amp;#8220;agenda&amp;#8221; as we might call it today.  It is interesting that he seems to point to personality as a far more influential force than politics at least directly) in how they interpreted relativism. Perhaps one remove still further away, though certainly in the same vein, is that modern eyes pained to read both the pendantic attitudes of earlier writers (though recognizing the values) as well as the illusory and/or biased nature with which some people allowed to guide their research.  Some might say this means that we have learned to not trust anyone; it might be a bit closer to the truth to say that we learned to never trust&amp;nbsp;ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That Noble Dream: The &amp;#8220;Objectivity Question&amp;#8221; and the American Historical Profession&lt;/em&gt; by Peter&amp;nbsp;Novick&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This to me was a very entertaining book but above that It made me stop and think of my own understanding of history.   It managed to enlighten me on the greater discourse that seems ever present in modern historical writing, that being Objectivity vs Relativity. Two very difficult concepts to define, to my understanding Objectivity is the school of historical thought ever obsessed with obtaining Truth.  &amp;#8221;Truth is one, not perspectival.&amp;#8221; Standing against this belief of a Truth within the Past are the relativists who embrace perspective and the multiplicity of relative truths, not simply&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dilemma really baffled me.  Where do I fall?  I realize that obtaining &amp;#8220;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; Truth&amp;#8221; from the past is seemingly impossible but the attempt must not  be abandoned.  When it comes to my understanding of Truth I would more likely fall with the relativists, but concerning my methods I would go with Objectivists as attempting  to undertake an understand of historical interpretations relative the &amp;#8220;the historian&amp;#8217;s[me] time, place, values, and purposes,&amp;#8221; would bog down my work to no&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning my thoughts on Mark Bevir&amp;#8217;s article,  it was a nice complement to the historical profession as he advocated a justification for objective knowledge outside the critiques &amp;#8220;the historicity of our being, the influence of power on discourse, [and] the absence of any stable meanings&amp;#8221; by applying by applying something very familiar in the historical tool box,&amp;nbsp;Comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Objectivity surely is an ideal that most of us would agree is worth striving for, even if we disagree regarding the extent to which it is attainable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Novick&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;That Noble Dream: The &amp;#8216;Objectivity Question&amp;#8217; and the American Historical Profession&amp;#8221; seeks to trace the evolution of attitudes toward that have accompanied the subject. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;Historical objectivity,&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; he says, &amp;#8220;is not a single idea, but rather, a sprawling collection of assumptions, attitudes, aspirations, and antipathies.&amp;#8221; That said, he outlines some of those permutations, along with their causes and their effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my estimation, Novick does an excellent job commingling his specific topic with the larger backdrop of American history. Therefore comprising, as it does, a more-or-less linear narrative, this work was one that I found highly engaging, and sometimes downright compelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His account of the rise of &amp;#8220;professional&amp;#8221; historians, their standards and their idea of truth was intriguing. Certainly, the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century brick-making analogy was a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially enjoyed Novick&amp;#8217;s examination of how the historical profession&amp;#8217;s development mirrored the socio-political history of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; from the Civil War era to the aftermath of World War I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the case of the former, I found it interesting to see another deviation from the idea that history is written by the victors: As pertains to slavery, the &amp;#8220;War Between the States&amp;#8221; and Reconstruction, &amp;#8220;the southerners cared so much more about the points at issue that in the interests of professional comity it seemed wise to let them have their way.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cataclysmic effects of the &amp;#8220;Great War,&amp;#8221; American historians certainly were not immune, losing &amp;#8220;the optimism and faith in progress which … had grounded their faith in objectivity,&amp;#8221; Novick says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#8217;s interesting to note that the subsequent relativism, which some said helped make World War &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; possible, certainly did not vanish after the latter global conflict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there is this quote from Frederick Jackson Turner: &amp;#8220;Each age writes the history of the past anew with reference to the conditions uppermost in its own time.&amp;#8221; The fact that he wrote those words in 1891 would seem to put to rest any notion of historical revisionism as a new phenomenon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, when thinking of changing attitudes toward certain once-revered historical figures and events, I cannot help but be struck by Novick&amp;#8217;s position that in times past, &amp;#8220;It was easy enough – indeed, requisite – that one take a loving attitude toward landmarks in the development of liberty and constitutionalism, or toward moments in the expansion of national power.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, in his article &amp;#8220;Objectivity in History,&amp;#8221; Bevir attempts to set forth a &amp;#8220;how-to.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain of his principles, including the nature of truth and the importance of criticism, square nicely with ideas found in Novick&amp;#8217;s work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Bevir takes matters a step further with his emphasis on &amp;#8220;comparing rival webs of interpretations in terms of agreed facts,&amp;#8221; in a &amp;#8220;more or less continuous&amp;#8221; fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In doing so, he presents what seems to be a credible argument for a worthwhile approach to the pursuit of objectivity.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8399157107533224051-7441704666127742489?l=bumpusjournal.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;In Chapter 11, Novick notes that the post-&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt; swing back to an historical consensus was like a pendulum swing back from the relativism of the interwar period.  I had this idea throughout the book as the author presented his main narrative, apart from the side story and details of increasing numbers of professors and history doctorates awarded and the decreasing salaries.  In reading the book, I felt that the pendulum was often driven by the societal contexts in which the historians were working: endowed positions that sought historians who fulfilled the views of donors, the interwar lack of optimism, for lack of a better word, and the general consensus found, at least superficially, after &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novick&amp;#8217;s book was interesting, but sometimes difficult to wade through.  I feel as though I&amp;#8217;ve been presented with so many names and opposing ideas that I can&amp;#8217;t keep them straight.  Becker and Beard, who came up quite frequently, are certainly two who are memorable, with their relativist leanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bevir&amp;#8217;s article is an interesting take on objectivity and seems to be an attempt to reach a middle ground.  Absolute objectivity cannot exist, contrary to the views of American historians c.1900, but complete relativism is also unwarranted.  As a budding historian considering how objective it is possible to be, and how much my experiences/circumstances/life will color or should color my historical interpretations and writings, I can see merit in his idea that a type of objectivity can be found through comparison of theories and arguments with an eye toward finding where they agree and how they diverge.  He draws an important distinction between responding to criticism through simple defense of a theory vs. altering or advancing that theory in response to critics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I agree with that thrust of his argument, the article itself is a little too philosophical for me, and I take issue with some of the assertions he makes and the way he supports them.  I often found that he used an extreme case as an example and then generalized the result to more moderate instances.  The best example is his argument that because humans can perceive the difference between a dog and a wolf (and therefore continue to survive), human perceptions are generally true.  There&amp;#8217;s a biological, survival instinct that encourages us to know the difference between something we can trust and something that could eat us.  The inability to perceive facts and correct theories in history may deny us a degree and subsequent employment in the historical field, but it, on its own, will not kill us&amp;#8230;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6220711600267285330-5129396384740940416?l=jawhite21.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <id>/history510/blog/objectivity.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Mark Bevir&amp;#8217;s article is an incisive look at historical objectivity; supporting the rejection of a &amp;#8220;given past&amp;#8221; and instead rooting objectivity in comparative study. The notion that history can be understood in terms of a &amp;#8220;given past&amp;#8221; has been rejected by Foucault, Gadamer, and Derrida, among others. Humans define things necessarily using present understandings, therefore historians cannot fully divorce ourselves from present assumptions inherent in our logic and reasoning. This means that &amp;#8220;we cannot grasp the past as a presence, and that this threatens the very possibility of objective historical&amp;nbsp;knowledge.&amp;#8221;(329)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Bevir argues that &amp;#8220;historical objectivity which relies on criteria of comparison, not on our having access to a given past&amp;#8221;(329). He offers a rejection of empiricists, in line with Foucault, Gadamer, and Derrida, saying that &amp;#8220;we do not have pure experiences. The nature of a perception depends on the perceiver&amp;#8221;(330). However, Bevir does not discount human perception entirely. While any individual perception may be flawed, human capacity to perceive the world around them on the whole is generally reliable(341). I would go further to say that if we discount all human perceptions as inherently without value because they are depend on certain underlying assumptions and on subjective understanding, then we have nothing left to work with and all historical study becomes a moot point. Bevir also cleverly points out that there are underlying assumptions in the hard sciences, as well as the humanities, since all are based on human experience in some&amp;nbsp;way(332). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central to Bevir&amp;#8217;s argument is a separation between &amp;#8220;fact&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;truth.&amp;#8221; He writes that &amp;#8220;a fact is a piece of evidence which nearly everyone in a given community would accept as true (333). This denotes perception and theory as part of the observation. He argues that it is not the historians job (nor is the individual historian capable of) discerning universal &amp;#8220;truths,&amp;#8221; rather we must content ourselves with endeavoring to find what is most &amp;#8220;correct,&amp;#8221; based on available facts and objective&amp;nbsp;interpretation(332). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bevir then examines interpretations of Locke&amp;#8217;s Two Treatises in accordance with his theory. He also points out the importance of intellectual honesty in remaining objective and advocates the necessity of collaboration at arriving at the best possible interpretations over time. Criticism needs to have a positive replacement to be of value, not simply attempt to demolish previous &amp;#8220;webs of interpretations,&amp;#8221; and historians must respond to criticism without blindly adhering to existing webs, but being open to new interpretations(337, 335). In this sense, I wonder if it would be fair to compare Bevir to Charles S. Peirce, in the idea that knowledge is only possible through prolonged, collaborative&amp;nbsp;effort. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sections I-&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;III&lt;/span&gt; of Peter Novick&amp;#8217;s book, That Noble Dream, relate to this article in a few ways.  Most obviously, the subject of this work is also objectivity. Novick charts the differing notions and forms of objectivity in American historical scholarship, starting in the 19th Century with the founding of the American historical profession through the 20th Century(16). He also presents a difference between the understanding of fact and truth among some scholars(103). Additionally, in his evaluation of Turner, he also presents a passage from that historian that echoes Bevir&amp;#8217;s arguments for intellectual honesty and having a web of interpretations. Turner argues that a historian is &amp;#8220;the parent of a family of hypotheses; and …he is forbidden to fasten all his affections unduly upon any&amp;nbsp;one&amp;#8221;(92). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly interesting to me was Novick&amp;#8217;s attention to the way various wars have impacted how American historians interpreted objectivity and their role in society. First mentioned here is the drive to promote reconciliation and &amp;#8220;nonpartisan&amp;#8221; views of the Civil War(72). This then coupled with racism as a &amp;#8220;consensual &amp;#8216;usable past&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; was also tied to Anglo-Saxon heritage and genetic &amp;#8220;evidence&amp;#8221; of black inferiority(74-76). This philosophy was extended backward to revision the history of the American Revolution, as well(82). Objectivity was challenged during and after &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WWI&lt;/span&gt;, as &amp;#8220;many historians lost the optimism and faith in progress which, as we have seen, had grounded their faith in objectivity. And the war itself became the subject of interminable historical controversy, undermining the faith that professional historical scholarship could converge on a consensual objective truth&amp;#8221;(111). &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt; shattered any moral standing of cultural relativism, some going further to say it weakened the nation against communism or fascism. There was a new interest in finding universal values between times and&amp;nbsp;cultures(284-85). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally during the Cold War, there was the creation of Western civ and the claim that objectivity was one of the principle unifying characteristic of this Atlantic world. This sought to distinguish totalitarianism with the freedom of the West(299). Unlike the historical trend following &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WWI&lt;/span&gt;, the post-&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt; and Cold War &amp;#8220;mobilization of historians&amp;#8221; lasted for decades(302). Important to each of these war periods, however, was the notion that dissent was unpatriotic and the somewhat malleable idea of&amp;nbsp;objectivity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the quest for objectivity seems to be a perilous one, particularly when we as historians admit ourselves to be influenced by both subliminal and tacit imperatives of the present. I would tend to agree with Bevir&amp;#8217;s evaluation, that objectivity is attainable by examining evidence based on a criteria of comparison, but would probably qualify it by saying objectivity is most approachable in this manner, but may not be fully attainable. That said, limited objectivity does not preclude a workable understanding of the past, and besides, our biases will give the historians of the next generations additional points to discuss. I don&amp;#8217;t intend that flippantly, as I tend to agree with Peirce, that the more analyses the better, however individually flawed each may&amp;nbsp;be.  &lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Peter Novick, &lt;em&gt;That Noble Dream&lt;/em&gt; | Mark Bevir, &amp;#8220;Objectivity in&amp;nbsp;History&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was struck this week by Peter Novick&amp;#8217;s sweeping review of objectivity; in many respects, Novick&amp;#8217;s work was less a history of objectivity and more of a history of American professional history.  Objectivity is cleverly used as a vehicle to examine the growth and development of the&amp;nbsp;profession. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its infancy, professional historians found a sense of certitude in history as the story of man&amp;#8217;s progress.  Because they were rooted in scientific processes, methodological, cultural, political, and ideological judgments were unassailable and protected them from criticism.  The Great War changed all of that; the pre-war certitude which characterized the profession&amp;#8217;s faith in progress eroded, creating a declining confidence in professionalism that helped call the associated doctrine of objectivity into question during the 1920s and 1930s.  Relativism would reign supreme during this&amp;nbsp;period.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, World War &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; would shift the foundations of the industry yet again, as relativism, pragmatism, legal realism, and the social sciences came under increasing attack.  During the post-war boom, historians constructed a new, somewhat chastened, partially hybridized objectivist synthesis which trivialized the relativist critique.  Novick ultimately asserts that American historians were compelled to take sides in a larger ideological struggle; because it was a war of absolutes, the Cold War could not allow for indecisiveness and&amp;nbsp;relativism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logical extension of Novick&amp;#8217;s argument is that American historians have never really been concerned with objectivity at all, that it was merely a buzzword of the profession used to defend professionalism.  From this perspective, Novick&amp;#8217;s assessment corresponds to Bevir&amp;#8217;s argument against empirical objectivity.  Bevir suggests that empirical objectivity is impossible because man&amp;#8217;s experiences or observations are innately personal and embody the theoretical categories of the individual having the insight.  Thusly, man cannot determine conclusively whether an individual theory is true or false because such judgment will be based on theoretical assumptions embodied in his&amp;nbsp;observations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bevir then argues for a comparative objectivity.  For him, objectivity is created by &amp;#8220;comparing and criticizing rival webs of interpretations in terms of facts&amp;#8221; upon which most historians tend to agree within their specific discipline (334).  Reduced to an analytical exercise, objectivity is rooted in ideas of professionalism and comity which require: criticism to be given and taken seriously; frowns upon dismissing contrary evidence as a mere exceptions or deviations from the truth; a presumption against purely face-saving responses to critiques of theories.  In short, Bevir&amp;#8217;s comparative objectivity is founded on little more than intellectual&amp;nbsp;honesty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two, Novick&amp;#8217;s was certainly the most thought provoking read.  Objectivity has certainly ebbed and flowed in American professional history, and Novick suggests that while there have been concerted dissents for and against relativism, objectivity, and professionalism, the flux of objectivity is largely the result of events outside the control of historians.  Objectivity is, therefore, an ideal which is—depending on which side of the aisle you are on—either a goal to be sought after, or an unattainable pipe dream which clouds the true motives of&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logical extension of Novick&amp;#8217;s argument is that American historians have never really been concerned with objectivity at all, that it was merely a buzzword of the profession used to defend professionalism.  From this perspective, Novick&amp;#8217;s assessment corresponds to Bevir&amp;#8217;s argument against empirical objectivity.  Bevir suggests that empirical objectivity is impossible because man&amp;#8217;s experiences or observations are innately personal and embody the theoretical categories of the individual having the insight.  Thusly, man cannot determine conclusively whether an individual theory is true or false because such judgment will be based on theoretical assumptions embodied in his&amp;nbsp;observations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bevir then argues for a comparative objectivity.  For him, objectivity is created by &amp;#8220;comparing and criticizing rival webs of interpretations in terms of facts&amp;#8221; upon which most historians tend to agree within their specific discipline (334).  Reduced to an analytical exercise, objectivity is rooted in ideas of professionalism and comity which require: criticism to be given and taken seriously; frowns upon dismissing contrary evidence as a mere exceptions or deviations from the truth; a presumption against purely face-saving responses to critiques of theories.  In short, Bevir&amp;#8217;s comparative objectivity is founded on little more than intellectual&amp;nbsp;honesty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two, Novick&amp;#8217;s was certainly the most thought provoking read.  Objectivity has certainly ebbed and flowed in American professional history, and Novick suggests that while there have been concerted dissents for and against relativism, objectivity, and professionalism, the flux of objectivity is largely the result of events outside the control of historians.  Objectivity is, therefore, an ideal which is—depending on which side of the aisle you are on—either a goal to be sought after, or an unattainable pipe dream which clouds the true motives of&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Objectivity is an elusive, elusive thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book we read this week explained more than just what objectivity is and why it has been such a major part of American historiographic tradition, but took us through the development of historiography in the United States.  I found this a very informative and helpful work, and I&amp;#8217;m noticing that as the semester moves on I am having an easier time defining myself as a historian and what my philosophical views on history are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that in my beliefs of the probably, I agree with the relativists that true, objective fact is not going to be attained, and that assuming a historian can do so is both naïve and dangerous.  That being said, this book, and looking through the debates, makes me want to champion the objectivist cause, because I believe the pursuit of objectivity, in its original, real sense, is the most important thing a historian can do.  This book gives example after example of how historians have constantly been driven off the straight and narrow path, deviating from the objective lessons of history both due to their own personal/societal faults (like the big section on racism) or because of political expediency (both &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WW1&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WW2&lt;/span&gt; showed a lot of that).  It certainly is a false hope to believe that people will ever be able to either get to the entire truth of an issue or to put away all of their own biases, but I think it&amp;#8217;s a horrific idea to abandon the quest simply because of its unreachability. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Perhaps I listened to the Don Quixote soundtrack too much when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I think &amp;#8220;that noble dream&amp;#8221; is one that is vital for the profession.  I know that there is a strong motivation in a period of economic uncertainty to make the humanities somehow more &amp;#8220;relevant,&amp;#8221; as if learning about the world is not relevant enough, or to market them as practical skills (they&amp;#8217;re not, really), but to give up the idea of pure truth, the quest to discover the Platonic ideal of the past… well, that&amp;#8217;s the death of history as a field worth studying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will, of course, never really know the whole truth about the past.  Our use of documentary evidence immediately prevents that goal, because we have to rely on biased sources.  But the quest, the journey towards the truth—that is what we do, and even if we fail, and perhaps because we fail, that is how we become epic.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-8084122948642892740?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Our readings this week were thought provoking accounts on the various manifestations of Objectivity and Relativism theories in American historiography.&amp;nbsp; We read &lt;u&gt;That Noble Dream: The &amp;#8220;Objectivity Question&amp;#8221; and the American Historical Profession&lt;/u&gt;, by Peter Novik, and an article from &lt;em&gt;History and Theory&lt;/em&gt; titled &amp;#8220;Objectivity in History,&amp;#8221; by Mark Bevir.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the Bevir article first, and several questions crept to mind.&amp;nbsp; In employing objectivity to historical research, how would you work out problems of commensurability when the worldview of, for example, a medieval knight cannot be worked out from a twentieth century historian&amp;#8217;s point of view?&amp;nbsp; In this sense, the rationalization on pg 233 that &amp;#8220;facts&amp;#8221; can be related to each other to get at truth, is not enough tou counter the possibility of specious correlations by the author, which is a question of relativism.&amp;nbsp; I felt that Bevir did not address this problem sufficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need not have felt alone in this assessment, however, &lt;u&gt;That Noble Dream&lt;/u&gt; was&amp;nbsp;filled with many objections to the aspirations of objectivity by historians throughout&amp;nbsp;America&amp;#8217;s history&amp;nbsp;of the profession,&amp;nbsp;which began&amp;nbsp;in the 1880s.&amp;nbsp; Novick&amp;#8217;s thesis is that, in general, ojectivists&amp;nbsp;won out over&amp;nbsp;the majority of the historiographical timeline due&amp;nbsp;to extenuating circumstances in American history such as&amp;nbsp;World War &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; and the Cold War, which&amp;nbsp;gave rise to&amp;nbsp;conformist attitudes among historians in order to defeat external threats to the nation.&amp;nbsp; However, Novick credits relativists like Becker and Bean with&amp;nbsp;performing&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;an important service in freeing historians from the belief that &amp;#8216;the facts spoke for themselves,&amp;#8217; (pg 410), and suggests that&amp;nbsp;a happy medium has developed over time despite the often heated debate&amp;nbsp;between objectivism and relativism.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps subconsciously, American historians adoped a historiographical philosophy Bruce Kuklick described as that of the &amp;#8220;ideal observer.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp; According to Kuklick, this person &amp;#8220;has the characteristics&amp;nbsp;attributable to the ideal historian:&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;There will be one correct evaluation in every situation calling for evaluation&amp;#8230; It will be necessary, at least theoretically, for everyone finally to agree on the truth-value of any evaluation&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp; These evaluations would then be declared &amp;#8216;objective,&amp;#8217; (pg 409).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the end, this is very close to Bevir&amp;#8217;s idea of objectivity,&amp;nbsp;but it also&amp;nbsp;allows for an amalgum of&amp;nbsp;personal judgement, which the relativists taught is impossible to avoid, and objectivism, which is an admirable goal, but is equally impossible to achieve.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8880139849602883287-1849286676083379456?l=dixonro.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;When I first began reading &lt;i&gt;That Noble Dream&lt;/i&gt;, I was initially impressed with Novick&amp;#8217;s approach and the clarity of his analysis. Although I remained favorably inclined to these aspects throughout the remainder of the book, my enthusiasm for the Novick&amp;#8217;s work diminished somewhat the more I read. To be fair, my relative disinterest stemmed solely from preconceived expectations that remained unfulfilled and not from any shortcomings within the book itself. My biggest shock was the degree to which Novick focused on institutional and technical elements of the historical profession, such as the shifting status of professional historians and changing job prospects, to name a few. Upon reflection, however, I acknowledged that incorporating such information was simply weaving in yet another important strand in the history of objectivity in America.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Perhaps my biggest complaint with Novick&amp;#8217;s book is the somewhat negative attitude he adopts toward American historiography. In the interest of objectivity, I realize that my offense probably stems from an innate sense of patriotism that resists the suggestion that American historians lack the finesse, skill and creativity of European historians. While I did not feel that these statements were direct criticisms of American historiography, I nonetheless wondered how different a book on objectivity in America would have been if written by an American, particularly the link between European historical developments and their ensuing influence in America or if such as link would even have been perceived. Once again, however, my personal complaint does not detract from the overall authority of the book.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;I believe that overall &lt;i&gt;That Noble Dream &lt;/i&gt;is a well-researched study that provides an informative and enjoyable overview of the role of objectivity in the American historical profession. I liked that Novick used the concept of objectivity as a focal point and examined how American historians have regarded and/or sought the realization of this goal over the last one hundred years. I was surprised at the degree to which Novick related internal academic developments to external forces, although I absolutely agree that approaching objectivity in this manner is critical to truly understanding America&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;quest for objectivity.&amp;#8221; Historians recognize that World War I and other major developments impacted nearly very aspect of American life, but rarely have I considered the intellectual and institutional ramifications of such events within an academic context, as does Novick.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed the complicated narrative of objectivity laid out by Novick; I did not get the sense that he attempted to constrain the history of objectivity into a neatly developmental path. Rather, he embraces the challenges this ideal faced as well as stimulants contributing to its furtherment in American history, both of which combined to create an intriguing picture of how this most elusive concept has contributed to the historical profession. As intended, Novick&amp;#8217;s study highlighted the undeniable relationship of objectivity to the American historical profession. Objectivity is not just an unreachable ideal that historians maintain in the interest of professionalism. It is and has been an important factor influencing American historiography, just as developments within American historiography have affected professional interpretations of objectivity. The mutual influence of this ideal with other aspects of the historical profession was one of my favorite parts of this book. I must also admit that I enjoyed the manner in which Novick treated historical study in America as a developing profession; he advanced a theory that assumed a more evolutionary and time-consuming process of professionalization than is frequently put forth. More importantly, however, he examines how the search for objectivity played a critical role in this process of professionalization. Overall, I found Novick&amp;#8217;s book to be informative and thought-provoking. It is certainly a long read, but one well worth the effort.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-50394054786589547?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;Imagine that, some of the wealthiest people in the area where American students of history first went seeking doctorates in Germany were the very professors they were learning from.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Of course, these students were from the upper class of America as well, but it was the idea that knowledge and learning commanded prestige and wealth that is so striking.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Now, all that is left is the prestige and honor of the title.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;But I digress.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;These early students brought the ideas of von Ranke back with them and began building American historical ideals.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The greatest achievement these early historians sought for was the elusive ideal of objectivity.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;If they could get the study of the past down to a science then bias would be removed entirely.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The problem was using the right science.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;In the period before &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WWI&lt;/span&gt;, historians were looking to professionalize their &amp;#8216;guild&amp;#8217; by setting certain standards and maxims.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Among these was defining truth as being what all who investigated found, or the idea of replicability, and redefining historical work as an &amp;#8220;academic&amp;#8221; enterprise. (52)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Thus professionalization would allow objectivity to exist.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;After &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WWI&lt;/span&gt; the idea of objectivity disintegrated.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Relativism entered the scene and the fight was on.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;For the war, historians had been pulled into creating history for elementary and high school.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This history was directed by the government though, seeking to indoctrinate the children with the exceptionalism of the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; and the greatness of American society.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Between the world wars, history was being replaced in the classroom by social studies; part history, part social science, but all relative to becoming good American citizens.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;As historians relinquished pre-collegiate classrooms in the quest for autonomy, they found their salaries continually lowered by universities and the students seeking admission to those programs, who would become the next generation of historians, coming from lower social strata than before.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The interwar years saw a growing number of scholars who pushed the idea of conflict and disunity, something the older generation vehemently sought to avoid with its Civil War views.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;The negativity and doubt of these years were replaced with the search for certainty as &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt; exploded onto the historical stage.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Relativism was linked to cynicism and nihilism as the world was divided by scholars into the &amp;#8220;free&amp;#8221; first world, the &amp;#8220;totalitarian&amp;#8221; second, and the odd men out third world. (281-3) After the war, many historians&amp;#8217; loyalty was questioned in the era of McCarthyism.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;To be painted with the subversive brush was to see the end of even the most promising academic career.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Ideologies were the buzzword of the day, and if yours did not match the norm, then here&amp;#8217;s your hat and there&amp;#8217;s the door.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This mindset brought objectivity back to the fore as it became the hallmark of thought in the Free World. (299)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The war also gave birth to &amp;#8220;Western civ&amp;#8221; classes to help further this Free World indoctrination, while historians saw &amp;#8220;the defense of freedom as the thread which wove American history together.&amp;#8221; (333) The postwar years saw a rise in confidence by historians, which came from better criteria for evaluation, a dominant research ethos, and more autonomy – the main desire of professionals. (361) In closing with the view of Richard Hofstadter, &amp;#8220;if a new or heterodox idea is worth anything at all it is worth a forceful overstatement.&amp;#8221; (338) Basically, go big or go home, which is in line with modern popular sentiments.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;If we are not willing to go all-in in this game of history, then we must settle for less than the best we can be.&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;This has been my favorite book since The Footnote, and for many of the same reasons.  Both books deal with social and cultural themes in a chronological sweep, both use a particular topic as an organizing structure for a lot of wide-ranging information, and both have really fun writing styles.  These are the sorts of books that generated and sustain my love for history.  The biggest difference between them—even more than world versus American scope—is that this book stuffs so much information in that I don&amp;#8217;t feel like I got it all.  I really want to read it again this summer when I can go more slowly, and write down the great quotes and metaphors and bits of irony he sprinkled throughout.  I like language as much as history, and this book was full of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find it kind of ironic and cheeky that in a book about objectivity, he seemed several times to be giving a fairly clear preference to relativism, and thereby rejecting objectivity on two levels simultaneously.  Right away, on pages one and two, he explained objectivity in such overblown terms and outsized expectations that he set me up to be skeptical.  I wondered at that point if he would lead us toward a more reasonable definition of objectivity, but if he did, it must have been after section three.  He also seemed to present objectivity as a goal with an agenda.  First, it would make historians more scientific and professional, then it would prepare citizens to be loyal and patriotic, then it would distinguish us from those ideological communists.  He seemed to lean toward conflating objectivity and absolutism.  In chapter three he said that objectivity forced historians to deny their assumptions, which made them the more powerful for being hidden (84).  Relativism, though, was presented in a positive light, as measured and reasonable and even gracious (401).  The only agenda I found here was a different way to create a universal perspective on history than the path objectivity was pursuing toward that same goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the connections he made between historiographical trends within and characteristics of culture without.  Before &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WW1&lt;/span&gt;, historians pushed objectivity as a way to seem scientific and professional, even as science was emerging and Literature and Art were leaving old moralizing for modern invisible authorship.  During and between the wars, relativism emerged both in response to discrepancies forced by wartime compromises and in tandem with developments in Literature, Art, and even Math, Physics, Logic, and Journalism.  After &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;WW2&lt;/span&gt;, objectivity was pulled out again as a way of distinguishing Us from Them—They were forced into ideological positions by repressive governments, but We were free from coercion and so able to write the Real Truth.  I also appreciated that even as he used this artificial periodization, he didn&amp;#8217;t bind himself within it; he showed how trends developed slowly and in the presence of the opposition, so the generalizations I just made were mitigated in the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also connected the fortunes of objectivity and relativism to the status of the profession in general.  The clearest place was in chapter nine where some historians objected to relativism because it would damage the field&amp;#8217;s professionalism, prestige, and morale.  That seemed an odd argument since—possibly due to his leading—I see relativism as more honest, and honesty as more professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, with a book this full that I liked this much, I could go on and on (keep the groans down, please) but I&amp;#8217;m just going to say again that I loved this book.  I hope the rest of the semester&amp;#8217;s are just like it.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-9078666779300531007?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The Origin of Capitalism presents a very interesting argument that capitalism, often assumed to be the natural result of social/economic progress, is in fact neither an inevitable outcome nor is it likely to be the permanent one. Ellen Meiksins Woods distinguishes between market opportunity and market forces, as she argues that compulsion more than opportunity directs interaction in capitalist exchanges(7). This idea that individuals in a &amp;#8220;free&amp;#8221; capitalist society are actually compelled by market forces acting on them is thoroughly explained and well-supported. She roots much of this shift in England tenant farming, where rent competitively determined land access. The farmers themselves had to improve production to be allowed access to the land to garner subsistence. The need to constantly improve production relative to one&amp;#8217;s fellows, however, shifted the focus from subsistence to profit. The reason for this change among the peasants was &amp;#8220;not the opportunity to produce for the market and to grow from petty producers into capitalists, but the need to specialize for the market and produce competitively—simply in order to guarantee access to the means of subsistence and to the land itself&amp;#8221;(53). This was contrasted to other countries, such as France, which could rely on extra-economic coercion(96, 100).Wood states explicitly on page 80 that this shift in social property relations that made individuals dependent on the market that generated capitalism. Capitalism is, however, unstable to its core, since it is based on continual growth and consumption in an ultimately finite world(85). Wood directly expresses her concern for the continued viability of such as system in the&amp;nbsp;conclusion(198-98).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood acknowledges Weber&amp;#8217;s interpretation of capitalism, noting that he also implies capitalism&amp;#8217;s inevitability as it is only absent in cultures where particular structures impeded its implantation. She notes that his analysis also furthers his goal of &amp;#8220;distinguish[ing]Europe from other parts of the world&amp;#8221;(17). This is not what most struck me about Weber. I found his argument about the changing attitude toward work the most interesting of his ideas. There is unquestionably a break between Catholic and Protestant teachings on the role of work in society. In Catholicism, faith and good works together are required to ascend to Heaven after death, but in Protestant religions, an individual gains salvation through faith alone. However, one&amp;#8217;s profession ought to be to the glory of God, as opposed to a less congruent sample of good works accumulated throughout a lifetime, as Catholics were believed to do. He argues that to Protestants, one&amp;#8217;s profession was one&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;calling,&amp;#8221; which necessarily took on a religious character(28-30). He also notes, however, that Catholics are more likely to become master craftsmen, which I do not see how that bolsters his&amp;nbsp;argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weber&amp;#8217;s attention to the fact that Luther translates work in different ways is very important to his argument and a sound historical observation(55). However, there were many other places throughout the book where I felt he lacked historicism. In addition to  his clear bias toward certain religions, he also failed to fully explain his own analysis, insisting that definitions are better left until later or that &amp;#8220;this is not the place for&amp;#8221; further inquiry. I disagree with the editor that the shifting nature of his terms and lack of concrete definitions or explanations allows him to &amp;#8220;constantly elude refutation&amp;#8221;(xxiv). I did not think historians allowed one another to avoid peer criticism by being deliberately vague. Weber spends a section of the work talking about the individual Protestant sects, but then, as he is relating them back to his thesis, insists that one(Calvinism) will be sufficient to demonstrate his point. After taking time to highlight the differences within Protestantism, he then discounts it(105). It was an interesting idea that individualism has its roots in Calvinistic doctrine, since each man is fully on his own, and no one can help him gain salvation, but I do not think he adequately supports his claim that this is the foundation for the spirit of capitalist. It may be a contributing factor, or an intriguing psychological parallel, but I am not convinced that it is the sole genesis of this all-encompassing worldview(which I would also argue, we still have yet to adequately&amp;nbsp;define).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading the two together (and enjoyed reading Wood) because Weber certainly falls into one of Wood&amp;#8217;s criticisms that we consider capitalism the fated conclusion of economic development; Weber could not be more triumphalist in his examination of capitalism than coupling its birth with the Protestant Reformation, a movement he clearly&amp;nbsp;supported.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;These readings were a perfect cap for materialism, and I got really into them, much to my surprise. Ellen Meiksins Wood&amp;#8217;s book, The Origin of Capitalism, was a fantastic little read, and I managed to be done with it by the time I touched down in Philadelphia. I liked the view of agrarian capitalism, which she very convincingly portrayed. It is clear, to anyone who studies the medieval world, that trade and urbanization alone cannot be the only factors needed to create capitalism. The Dutch Republic example was very persuasive, and I thought of examples of international trade routes like the Amber Road and the Silk Road, the gold and slaves route through the Sudan during the Roman and Arab periods, the Phoenician trade networks… city-states and trade networks, metropolis and urban societies have existed for a long, long time. If cities and trade were all that were needed, with some industrialization mixed in, why wouldn&amp;#8217;t Byzantium have succeeded?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The English agrarian model, which blames the English for capitalism (and yes, I know that was not what she was saying, but over the last few weeks I&amp;#8217;ve started disliking capitalism more and more), makes perfect sense, and the fact that it capitalism creates the proletarian-industrial mix in this theory really works for me. I personally believe agriculture to be the backbone of any economy (yes, I have dark thoughts about the house of cards of Western prosperity as a result), so the agrarian model really touched a chord with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The line she uses, that production of the basic means of survival being market dependent is the marker of capitalism (p. 140) is a great way to look at it. No choice outside of the system.&lt;br /&gt;Max Weber&amp;#8217;s work was a fun read. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what of it I buy, but it was enjoyable and different. Unlike Wood, who argues that capitalism is neither universal nor inevitable, and certainly badly misunderstood, Weber doesn&amp;#8217;t argue the universality or inevitability of capitalism, but looks at the &amp;#8220;Protestant ethic,&amp;#8221; something I&amp;#8217;ve heard about for years—the idea that Calvinism is a direct source of capitalism and the doctrine of prosperity. Given the doctrine of predestination, where you are either saved or not, you have to live like you are—this means prosperity and blessings have to be upon you, and you have to &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;KNOW&lt;/span&gt; you are saved—you have to be so convinced of your self-righteousness that you never doubt it, because doubt is a sign of not being full of grace and thus being damned. The inherent problems with that idea are so vast, and outside of this paper, but &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;MAN&lt;/span&gt; I dislike Calvinism as a theological doctrine. Where this comes into play materially is that you are expected to be prosperous and have a life filled with the blessings of the Lord, so you work hard to keep yourself out of trouble, earn a lot, create something for yourself to show that God has favored you. Just make sure not to enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These readings were, on an enjoyment level, much better than the last two weeks. I like that they look at different roots of capitalism, and challenge the concept of capitalist inevitability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good readings, looking forward to the discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and did anyone else notice that Weber said basically that Catholics are all the scholars and Protestants all the business men? I know the second part is his point, but the first? I love it.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-3888606977097685145?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

However, just as that system&amp;#8217;s merits are debatable, so, too, are its origins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Weber&amp;#8217;s pioneering 1904-05 work, &amp;#8220;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,&amp;#8221; was his attempt to frame that economic system&amp;#8217;s start in socio-religious terms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the process, as he delves into the Reformation, he invokes the specter of predestination. And here he delivers one of his most intriguing ideas. Per that particular doctrine: Folks&amp;#8217; eternal destination was already decided, and there was nothing they could do about it. Per Weber&amp;#8217;s corollary: For many, the suspense was too much to bear, naturally, so they sought a sign; they worked to show &lt;i&gt;themselves &lt;/i&gt;that they were approved unto God, as secular success must mean heavenly sanction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How bizarre. How paradoxical. And yet, how viscerally satisfactory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it is with many of Weber&amp;#8217;s explanations. His is ultimately a well-reasoned, if rather unscientific, treatment (as noted, criticized and/or excused in the Norton Critical Edition&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Contexts&amp;#8221; section).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ellen Meiksins Wood, in &amp;#8220;The Origin of Capitalism&amp;#8221; (1999), likewise presents a wholly plausible account. However, her approach – framed in socio-cultural terms – seems more balanced than Weber&amp;#8217;s, or, put another way, less encumbered by a predestined conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, her ideas regarding capitalism&amp;#8217;s specific provenance are more convincing than Weber&amp;#8217;s rather vague views on that count. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, her key criticism of attitudes whereby capitalism&amp;#8217;s emergence was &amp;#8220;the realization of ever-present tendencies&amp;#8221; is hammered home a bit too frequently, perhaps, but still is well-taken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I find both works to be quite compelling in their own ways – Weber&amp;#8217;s as a triumph of the imagination, Wood&amp;#8217;s as an exercise in thorough, unremitting rationality.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8399157107533224051-1013976427310856866?l=bumpusjournal.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;I found this week&amp;#8217;s economic readings much more interesting than those of the previous weeks, likely because the books this week had a stronger cultural emphasis to which I could respond.  On one hand, I rather wish we had read these two works, or at least  Wood&amp;#8217;s, as the first foray into economic history, as it clarified  several points for me.  On the other hand, I can see how her reading  would have biased us about the other works (and of course, if she&amp;#8217;s  going to discuss Marx, it helps to have read some of his writings in  advance).  Also, I am unable to say whether I understood her work better  because it was written on more of an intro level, or because I &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;had&lt;/span&gt; been previously and recently exposed to some of the concepts she is discussing and the theories against which she is arguing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weber&amp;#8217;s exploration of the capitalist spirit as it intersects with religion was intriguing, if outdated (oh, sociology-type writings from the early 1900s&amp;#8230;).  His idea that the spirit of capitalism originated in the asceticism of Protestant religions, with the combination of the concept of a &amp;#8220;calling&amp;#8221; and doing your work on earth to please a god, was interesting, if unconvincing.  I would have preferred if he had expounded on his views about Catholicism, as they contrast to those about Protestantism&amp;#8212;it would have created a stronger foundation, I feel, for his conclusions.  In reading his descriptions of the four Protestant religions under study, I found the one about Calvinism to be the most developed and lucid.  The remaining three seem to be shorter and less developed, largely since they play off all the ideas already set down for Calvinism, but I still found them lacking.  I came away from the Calvinist description with a strong understanding of how it might contribute to the &amp;#8220;Protestant work ethic,&amp;#8221; as Weber sees it, but I was left unsure with the remaining three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wood&amp;#8217;s goal is to situate the development of capitalism in a specific time and location, with specific causes, and I admire her for doing so.  Not being very familiar with economic history, I am unable to comment on her views that most economic historians either take the origins of capitalism for granted or explain them by virtue of capitalism existing, in a begging-the-question fashion.  Her book argues strongly against the idea that history ended with the fall of the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;USSR&lt;/span&gt;, as we discussed last week; her idea that capitalism originated under specific circumstances implies that a new economic system could begin, given the right situation.  I felt the last part the book deteriorated when she began discussing the role of capitalism in imperial societies and in the modern world.    As to the length of the updated edition, which she discusses, I am torn.  The book is rather repetitive with its assertions, especially in the beginning when she repeatedly critiques previous explanations of capitalism.  While this was somewhat irritating, it was also helpful, as she continually reminded the reader about her thesis.  (Additionally, I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen the words &amp;#8220;fetters&amp;#8221; used so much in one book before&amp;#8212;I kept wanting to tell her to find a thesaurus somewhere&amp;#8230;)&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6220711600267285330-8922751818859422138?l=jawhite21.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;The Origin of Capitalism is a book written by Ellen Meiksins Wood.  In this book before proposing her own theory of the origin of capitalism she effectively breaks down previous understandings of the origin of Capitalism such as Marxists understand of its origins and what Marxists claimed to be fighting the &amp;#8220;commercialization Model.&amp;#8221;  One of her major critiques of previous Capitalist origin theories was their assumption that Capitalism was an inevitable end to human history, that all throughout history, Capitalism has been attempting to surface but was held back by social and political constraints.  This idea is the &amp;#8220;Commercialization Model.&amp;#8221;   As Wood pointed out, in Marxist critiques of the old system, they still held on to this model, thus making their attacks also&amp;nbsp;flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed Wood&amp;#8217;s attack of euro-centric Capitalism as she quickly pointed out that the only thing that set Western Europe apart was Imperialism, as it gave Europeans the necessary amount of capital to overtake other parts of the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood proposes that capitalism was not an inevitable outcome out of feudalism, as feudalism produced many outcomes in Europe, such as absolutist France.  Wood proposes that the development of Capitalism in some areas in Western Europe was due to the lack of goods and thus need in their respective markets to expand outside the continent. Once this need was there it was followed by an evolution of the &amp;#8220;social property relations that generated market imperatives and capitalist &amp;#8216;laws of motion,&amp;#8217; which imposed themselves on production.&amp;#8221;(pg 77)Wood does also mention that Max Weber&amp;#8217;s Protestant Ethic did influence in part the development of Capitalism in Western&amp;nbsp;Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max Weber&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;The Protestant Ethic and the &amp;#8216;Spirit&amp;#8217; of Capitalism&amp;#8221; attempted to explain capitalism outside of the materialistic terms that Marx set as standard.  I found this admirable.  He promoted the ideas of work as means of glorification of God and self-improvement through work, which got translated into the promotion of&amp;nbsp;Capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;My first thoughts when I realized that the readings for this week dealt yet again with the issue of capitalism were, to say the least, unenthusiastic. I was cheered slightly upon being told that the approaches adopted by Weber and Wood avoided the materialistic basis of previous readings, but the initial dread still loomed. When I finally brought myself to read the selections, however, I must admit myself pleasantly surprised. It was quite refreshing to read a more culturally-derived analysis of capitalism, and I found these examinations to be much more intellectually stimulating than materialistic explanations. Perhaps it is because my knowledge and understanding of economics leaves something to be desired, but for me Wood and Weber&amp;#8217;s arguments provided a more historically grounded and encompassing study of the development of capitalism, although I was not always entirely persuaded of their conclusions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Although I did not initially expect much of Weber&amp;#8217;s writings, it took only a few pages to grasp both my interest and my respect. Weber was clearly an intelligent man, but more than that I respect his boldness and innovation for advancing such a theory in the first place. The link between religion and capitalism is not one that many would discern, much less be able to provide support for. This is not to say I was entirely convinced of his assertions, for much of the time I felt that he either over-emphasized or over-generalized parts of his argument.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;His central contention for the influence of Protestant ethics on the development of a capitalist society is, however, intriguing and deserving of serious consideration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;As I read Weber&amp;#8217;s text, I grew increasingly curious about his opinion of capitalism and the ensuing capitalist society. It soon became clear that the constant for Weber was religion, not capitalism. This does not mean that Weber saw religion as unchanging, merely that he always maintained a positive attitude toward the inclusion of religion in society. According to Weber, when capitalism first emerged it did so in response to new religious mores that advocated hard work and perseverance. Under these new Protestant ethics, particularly those held by Calvinists, people were not only free to pursue the accumulation of wealth but indeed compelled by duty to do so. Only by refraining from idleness and dedicating one&amp;#8217;s life to improvement and work could one please God.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Weber referred to this as the &amp;#8220;spirit of capitalism&amp;#8221; and it was this mood that characterized the early stages of capitalist development. When religious ethics played a part, Weber appears to be okay with the presence of capitalism. As capitalism grew to be more firmly entrenched, however, it depended less on people and became more of an impersonal self-sustaining system. At this point, Weber&amp;#8217;s tone turns much more critical. I found his overall approach interesting because it entailed the forced continuation of such a system, not its voluntary maintenance. People participated in capitalism because they had to; it had grown to be far too encompassing for individuals to exist outside of.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;My favorite part of Weber&amp;#8217;s argument, however, was his brief examination of how Protestant ethics affected not only the development of capitalism but aspects of a capitalist society. Indeed, I was intrigued simply by his emphasis on the existence of a capitalist society. It is certainly not a new concept, but it is one that&amp;nbsp; I had not dedicated much thought to previously. When I thought of societies and cultures, I usually defined them in terms of nations, etc. When I thought of capitalism, my mind turned to purely economic matters. I enjoyed having a conscious redirection that integrated the two ideas and made me think of capitalism in a substantially more rounded, and admittedly more accurate, manner. Weber&amp;#8217;s ability to draw connections between religious ideas and ensuing cultural developments never failed to leave me impressed, regardless of the level of conviction with which I regarded them. &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;At times, however, I grew somewhat impatient with Weber&amp;#8217;s deep analysis of religious principles. I sometimes felt as if I was reading a theological survey more than a historical inquiry. I may not have preferred it, but Weber&amp;#8217;s dedication to proving the beneficial involvement of religion in society made this approach at least understandable. &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;His later writings in particular stressed the positive advantages gained by incorporating the religion into daily life, notably in capitalist societies where the Church could serve to counteract the individualistic and impersonal tendencies that dominated fully-developed capitalism. Although Weber provided a religious explanation for the growth of capitalism, he does acknowledge the importance of considering materialistic explanations as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;If I was pleasantly surprised upon reading Max Weber&amp;#8217;s writings, I found myself strangely delighted at Ellen Wood&amp;#8217;s book. Between her decision to focus on society rather than economics, the book&amp;#8217;s clear and concise writing style and the innovative ideas it contained, &lt;i&gt;On the Origins of Capitalism&lt;/i&gt; was easily my favorite book so far this semester. It was made even more appealing because it followed the series of, for me, less enjoyable books we have read in the preceding weeks. &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Wood&amp;#8217;s main emphasis fell on addressing social influences on the development on capitalism as opposed to Weber&amp;#8217;s focus on religion. There were a number of other comparisons and contrasts between Weber and Wood that I found very interesting; I was glad to have the Wood book to guide my reflections upon Weber&amp;#8217;s work so that these links were clarified. Wood identified several main goals she hoped her book would accomplish: emphasizing social influences on capitalism, challenging the inevitable treatment capitalism has received, and advancing a forced interpretation of involvement in capitalist societies. By advancing these arguments, Wood placed herself in opposition to much of what Weber wrote, although the two agreed on some points. One thing the Weber and Wood did share was distaste for fully developed capitalism, although in Wood&amp;#8217;s case distaste is perhaps an understatement. I thoroughly enjoyed reading such a strong critique of the capitalist system, particularly one that challenged the Euro-centric nature of much of the literature on the development of capitalism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Perhaps my favorite part of Wood&amp;#8217;s argument was her conviction that capitalism needs to be understood as a historically specific phenomena that emerged in response to a particular set of social relations. I believe that this approach provides a better understanding of capitalism because it does not try to force the development of a single all-encompassing explanation, and it also redresses the injustice done to historical studies that try to impose the capitalist system where it does not fit. According to Wood, feudalism was not a necessary precursor to the emergence of capitalism. She proves this point even within Europe by surveying both English and French historical developments that began from a similar starting point yet ended up in very different spots. Wood argues, contrary to much capitalist literature, that true capitalism began in the English countryside in response to a shift in the social relations between peasants and lords. From England, it spread through the international market to other areas as well. I enjoyed this interpretation of capitalism&amp;#8217;s development even more once Wood analyzed other historical aspects from this perspective, such as her analysis examining how changing social relations and the beginnings of capitalism contributed to a sense of national identity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;Wood&amp;#8217;s book was a very informative read, not just because of the innovative ideas she provided but also because of the brief historiographical survey she included as well. It was interesting to see the invisible constraints that seemed to exist on capitalist studies, deterring the introduction of a truly revolutionary approach to the development of capitalism. I also found this book relevant to our earlier discussion concerning the value of big narratives as opposed to local studies. I felt that Wood did an admirable job of studying a broad theme without sacrificing the importance of regional variations, a difficult task to successfully achieve. To me, her book stressed the advantages of both sides; local circumstances played a critical role in her assessment of capitalism, but she posed her study within the larger framework of capitalist studies. Even when challenging predominant interpretations of capitalism, Wood needed to operate within this framework in order to provide a relevant historical study. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-7528055771631476798?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;Ellen Meiksins Wood explores the origins of capitalism and comes to a unique conclusion in this book.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;She first outlines the various debates and Marxist alternatives to the creation of capitalism.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;However, the main trouble she has with these treatises are that they assume the germ of capitalism existed before recorded history, and the emergence of capitalism was unavoidable once the removal of those pesky inhibitions of people to acquiring wealth were removed.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;She posits that &amp;#8220;capitalism was born when market imperatives seized hold of food production.&amp;#8221; (81)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;She goes further to say that capitalism did not begin in the city but in the countryside, and the rising number of propertyless rural labor gave the landowners a surplus labor pool to use. (95,102,103)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;The idea of &amp;#8216;agrarian capitalism&amp;#8217; foreshadowing industrial capitalism is interesting in that it is based on large land holders squeezing unproductive tenant farmers to the wall while utilizing wage laborers, which differs from the&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Marxist format of landlord-tenant-laborer.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The tenant farmers would be market-dependent if their land could not produce enough to sustain them.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This led her to the idea that market dependence was the cause of mass proletarianization. (131)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Since the landlords and farmers produced more food, a larger population was sustainable.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This would allow industrialization. This larger population would naturally live in cities, which made their means of self-reproduction market-dependent just like their means of production in that they must now buy their food.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Their consumption of necessities would drive both agricultural and industrial production goals.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This is what the author claims as the basis for the capitalist mode of production. (141)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;&#34;&gt;The need to sustain a growing population required that land was &amp;#8216;improved&amp;#8217; and not left idol, which meant increasing its output or production.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The idea of property rights became entangled with the need to improve it or lose the right to own it.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;As colonization began for England in the Americas, this idea of improving the land&amp;#8217;s production was brought along as well.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Whereas the Spanish argued the right of conquest to control their claims and the French formed working relations with Native populations, the English applied this natural law to their endeavors.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;In their view, since the Indians had not fenced in any land, or tried to improve it in any way like building houses, or raising cattle, then the land was open for the English to take as they would do what God had ordained and improve the area and make it valuable. (159)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;To me, this seems an underhanded way to steal from people.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Didn&amp;#8217;t the nobility in England have land that was not used for anything except hunting?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Was it their absolute dislike that these half naked heathens had some of the best land in the world that drove them to devise such a scheme as this?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Did they actually think that history would see them as noble for providing this &amp;#8216;gift&amp;#8217; to the backward people of the Americas?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;At least the Spanish were honest in that they in essence said, &amp;#8220;We want this and this, and we&amp;#8217;re just going to take it.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Try and stop us.&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4129143196680670213-4209091199402195595?l=historical-james.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a charming read, but it made me very grateful that the age of corsets and upper-class certainties is over.  Weber tried so hard to be scholarly and objective, and yet the overwhelming impression is of someone holding forth in the smoking lounge after an Edwardian dinner party.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said on page 29 that this would be a serious work and not a sermon, on page 30 he holds his tongue about genetic causes because they didn&amp;#8217;t yet have evidence, on page 45 he promised to leave behind &amp;#8220;vague and general concepts&amp;#8221; (Ha!), on pages 47-48 he claimed to look at examples before defining the Spirit of Capitalism, on page 91 he limited his goals and claims, on page 182 he rejected &amp;#8220;judgments of value and faith&amp;#8221; and he ended the book with a call for further study, all of which suggested a work of careful and thorough scholarship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But throughout the work he tossed in jewels like the imaginary workers&amp;#8217; &amp;#8220;congenial&amp;#8221; life being &amp;#8220;destroyed&amp;#8221; by a capitalist (66-68) ,which he defended in the endnote by saying it was &amp;#8220;of no consequence&amp;#8221; that it was imaginary (200).  On page 73 it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;hardly necessary to prove&amp;#8221; that this work ethos wasn&amp;#8217;t present before the rise of Protestantism imposed it.  (Since proving that is the point of the book, I started smelling brandy and cigars again.)  In chapter three he outdid himself:  &amp;#8220;…dimly felt rather than clearly perceived…&amp;#8221; (81), &amp;#8220;…hardly necessary to point out…&amp;#8221; (82), and &amp;#8220;…unnecessary to go into detail…&amp;#8221; (83).  After that I lost interest in collecting these little baubles, but I do wonder if some of the mind-numbing pages of details and proof in other books is a reaction to the blithe opinionating of Weber&amp;#8217;s era.  If so, I&amp;#8217;d like to call for a little moderation—support your points with actual examples instead of fancies, but don&amp;#8217;t describe every example to death.  And please cite your sources; that&amp;#8217;s a fabulous innovation that I&amp;#8217;ve loved and taken advantage of for years without truly appreciating until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, scholarship aside, his book did try to make some interesting points.  If I lace myself up and accept his sloppiness, I can see where this would have been an exciting innovation a hundred years ago  The distinction between amassing wealth for consumption versus for reinvestment is instructive (and rather remarkable considering the conspicuous consumption of the Gilded Age).  He tossed in the idea that Calvinists&amp;#8217; frequent refugee status may have influenced their approach to economics, but he didn&amp;#8217;t do anything with this.  His generalizations on pages 59-61 about people working only enough for subsistence echoed last week&amp;#8217;s book, yet it also seemed like justification for poverty wages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only know a little about Luther, but Weber&amp;#8217;s presentation of him supporting passive acceptance of your lot in life does fit with that scrap.  It was interesting, on page 89, that he admitted the original Calvinists didn&amp;#8217;t advocate amassing wealth as an end.  This means he&amp;#8217;s considering other religions at one point of development, and Calvinism at a different point.  I am more familiar with Reformed theology, and from that position I have to say that either he found some obscure little slice to examine, or else he just ignored inconvenient realities in favor of stereotypes and myths that supported his thesis better.  Confession and forgiveness have always been central, in one form or another, and predestination (before the unfortunate addition of double predestination) was a bedrock assurance of salvation irrevocable by any error or omission on the part of the sinner.  His comment in the Anabaptist section about asceticism being a denial of joy in this life also contradicts all I&amp;#8217;ve read and heard on that subject.  Everywhere else, it&amp;#8217;s a means of intensifying and focusing a deeper joy.  So, his chapter on religion was wrong except where I don&amp;#8217;t know very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter five, where he pulled together all of his opinions to prove his theses did hold together well, if I suspend a lot of disbelief.  There was a pervasive sense of duty in the 19th century, though I never saw it as denominationally limited.  I do have a sense—as unproven as his—that Southern planters were more leisurely and New England manufacturers were more uptight, but I always figured it was the climate.  And his claim that once Calvinism had established the capitalist ethos it became unnecessary for its perpetuation was very clever.  That eliminated all sorts of arguments based on present (even his present) realities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However vague and opinionated this book was, it has the gracious advantage of being lightweight and entertaining.  At this point in the semester; it&amp;#8217;s nice to have a little charming recess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Origin of Capitalism: a longer view&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this book, Ellen Meiksins Wood mentions and refutes several explanations of capitalism&amp;#8217;s rise, shows the elements that other explanations got right, and then gives her idea of what caused the shift to capitalism and how it then was able to spread around the globe.  Throughout the book, she is occasionally defensive and consistently repetitive, but despite those shortcomings she presents a clear and convincing argument for what really distinguishes capitalism from previous systems, and how it was set in motion, however inadvertently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid her repetitive habit, let me just say that her recurring complaint against Commercialization, Demographic, and World Systems/Dependency Theories as well as the Sweezy/Dobbs &lt;span class=&#34;amp&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Hilton Debate was that they all assumed that the development of capitalism was natural and inevitable.  They described various ways it developed, obstacles that had to be removed, and varieties of development, but none explained how it began, because they all assumed that it just did.  Sort of the &amp;#8220;if you remove the obstacles, it will arrive&amp;#8221; theory.  They also—to one extent or another—assumed that people naturally choose greater productivity and wealth when given options, not the greater leisure and familiarity that Weber suggested in his high wage/low wage example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She listed as well the people from whom she pulled pieces of her theory.  Karl Polanyi, Karl Marx, Perry Anderson, Robert Brenner, and &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt; Thompson all got glimpses of her reality even though they each fell short in one way or another.  My favorite part here was in the Perry Anderson section where feudalism was described, very drily and objectively, as the union of political and economic control.  David Lewis (in God&amp;#8217;s Crucible) called it the greatest protection racked every perpetrated by the powerful against the weak, or words to that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, she distilled all their contributions into her theory.  Basically, England had centralized political power and localized land ownership.  Because the landowners couldn&amp;#8217;t squeeze surplus by force, they charged rent, and eventually figured out that they could maximize their wealth by making rent competitive—giving land to the highest bidder.   This introduced increased productivity, which led to many pieces that combined into capitalism, well before industrialization or large and free cities in England.  The competition led to many people being driven off the land, becoming landless wage workers in London.  The greater productivity meant that the fewer remaining farmers could still feed the country despite the population explosion that seems to always follow advances in agriculture (even as long ago as Cahokia in 11th century North America). The mass of workers meant that industry had to develop efficiently to provide their basic needs cheaply.  The central location meant that the market was unified and therefore competitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She briefly mentioned that England also had the best-developed transportation network that also supported this transition, but she never considered how England&amp;#8217;s distance and humongous moat might have influenced its different development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did spend some time with the 17th century&amp;#8217;s fascination with &amp;#8220;Improvement.&amp;#8221;  She says this new focus grew out of the new need for productivity and competition, not from fear of not deserving your salvation like Weber claimed.  This makes a lot more sense, frankly, since so much of the Protestant Revolution was about throwing off the vestiges of having to earn your salvation. She also showed how this idea had developed from as far back as Thomas More in 1516, and how it was used to justify both enclosures at home and colonial appropriations abroad, all under the delusion that they were actually contributing more value to these communities, not stealing their livelihoods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She ended by saying that post-modernism is the latest school to conflate capitalism with something else, this time Enlightenment values.  Because they&amp;#8217;re intertwined, post-modernists want to overthrow the benefits of the Enlightenment in order to overcome the negative consequences of capitalism.  Only as we understand what capitalism truly is, apart from all the things that developed alongside it, will we be able to see a way to replace it with a more humane system.  And what capitalism truly is involves economic coercion by The Market, instead of military coercion by force.  Capitalism compels productivity just as insistently as previous systems compelled conformity to their needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last observation (complaint) is about her endnotes.  They would have been much more helpful if they&amp;#8217;d included a very brief description of what we&amp;#8217;d find if we tracked down the citations she provided.  She created in the text proper questions and hopes for examples or specifics that just are not answered by looking at the name of the source where they could be found.  I&amp;#8217;ve never been a fan of &amp;#8220;look it up; you&amp;#8217;ll remember it longer&amp;#8221; and this was a case of just that.  She also didn&amp;#8217;t have an alphabetical bibliography, which I missed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&amp;#8217;t realized until this week what an endnote Goldilocks I am.  &amp;#8220;Give me details, but not piles of them.  Give me facts, not stories (in the endnotes—I like stories in the text).  Give me sources, but not in place of answers.  Craft your endnotes to my specifications so they&amp;#8217;re Just Right.&amp;#8221;  (&amp;#8220;Please.&amp;#8221;)&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-5605347416899612936?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;I used the 2003 Dover edition of this book, which I was told would be okay since we are to focus on Weber&amp;#8217;s writing. &lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll try to use chapter references instead since page numbers will not line up.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Weber undertakes the task of identifying what capitalism is by looking at it through various division of Protestantism, occasionally comparing them to Catholicism.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;His overall stress on the argument seems to be that capitalism could only happen in the Occident – Western Europe and America.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;In the introduction he calls it &amp;#8220;the most fateful force in our modern life,&amp;#8221; which is a big statement.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;He further clarifies that unlimited greed is not true capitalism, and that a form of capitalism, or pre-capitalism, has existed everywhere.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;He starts with the notion that Protestants make better capitalists than Catholics because the latter&amp;#8217;s disdain for accumulation of wealth and ecclesiastical piety prevent them from making enough money to rise above the station in life wherein they were born. (Ch. 1)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;He goes on to break down denominations like Calvinists, Lutherans, Pietism, Methodists, and the various Baptist sects to explain how each brought capitalism into an accepted place with the Christian faith.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;As I was reading this, I got to&amp;nbsp;the place in Chapter &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; where it said, &amp;#8220;The sound of your hammer at five in the morning…&amp;#8221; and I thought, &amp;#8220;Isn&amp;#8217;t that from Poor Richards Almanac?&amp;#8221;&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Sure enough, when I turn the page, and from then on, Weber is referencing Franklin as the quintessential worker bee of capitalism.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;He also uses Franklin as a baseline when comparing the various religious groups as he worked to separate himself from any denominational affiliation.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Of course it helped that he was a deist.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;One last note I wanted to bring up.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;At the end of the next-to-last paragraph of Chapter &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;III&lt;/span&gt;, Weber states, &amp;#8220;At the same time we must free ourselves from the idea that it is possible to deduce the Reformation, as a historically necessary result, from certain economic changes.&amp;#8221;&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Did a lot of people in that time think that the Reformation was caused by economic forces?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;That is most interesting.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;He also said he believes the Reformation did not create capitalism, which is good since he first said that capitalism has been around forever.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Just my two cents.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was struck this week by Wood&amp;#8217;s rather slim volume on the origins and development of capitalism.  Yes, Max Weber is important, but Wood is able to dismiss him with a barely a single page of commentary.  According to Ellen Wood, the rise of capitalism was not inevitable—if anything it was an historical accident spurred on by a precise set of circumstances in a confined location.  Wood begins her discussion by dismissing the current historiography of capitalism&amp;#8217;s origins—including Marx—arguing that the dominant works either ignore the question of capitalism&amp;#8217;s origins, focus their investigations towards questions of why it did not develop elsewhere, or that they are invalid because they are anachronistic.  At their core, they all take on basic assumptions that profit is the single motive of mankind, and that capitalism arises naturally out of that motive.  Thus, the rise of capitalism is discussed in terms of overcoming obstacles to its&amp;nbsp;ascension. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevailing understanding fails to acknowledge the particular imperatives of capitalism, the mechanizations of market operations, or the laws of competition, profit maximization, and capital accumulation.  In Wood&amp;#8217;s opinion, capitalism is a very recent response to a specific set of circumstances arising in the agricultural economy of early modern England.  According to her evaluation, a basic market system existed in farming leases in which substantial landowners (most aristocrats) abandoned systems of extracting substantial rents out of tenet farmers in favor of coercing them to be more productive, thus increasing their&amp;nbsp;rents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supported by Locke&amp;#8217;s ruminations on property ownership and &amp;#8220;improvement&amp;#8221; of the land by using it to its maximum benefit, a system of agrarian capitalism developed.  The agrarian model promoted efficient farming, thereby enabling the most successful and efficient farmers (who produced greater income for their landlord through their efficient success) to work more land with less labor.  Thus, a largely landless laboring class developed which provided the requisite labor for Britain&amp;#8217;s nascent industrial revolution.  Britain&amp;#8217;s industrial growth was seen as a threat by other European nations who then forced capitalism on their societies in order to keep the pace in a zero-sum political system.  Imperialistic by nature, a fully capitalism caused Britain to embark on an age of empire-building, thus setting the stage for the eventual globalization of&amp;nbsp;capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, her theory is coherent, but I think there logical fallacy in it.  Wood&amp;#8217;s argument suggests two things: (1) that capitalism is not natural, that it is just a happy accident arising out of a specific set of circumstances, and (2) that as such, there are viable alternatives to capitalism which we may impose upon society.  Wood suggests socialism as a viable alternative.  The fact that she does not provide any framework for doing so can be overlooked.  The key is that she suggests it is possible because capitalism is not natural and was a choice.  Yet, in her own argument she posits that capitalism is, by its very nature, expansionistic—it will constantly spread by exploiting technology, labor, natural resources, and any other means at its disposal.  As an accidental development, it is entirely possible that capitalism might never have come into being.  However, given her stance on capitalism&amp;#8217;s innate expansionist drive, is it possible that having been established that capitalism can ever be toppled?  I don&amp;#8217;t think she has made her case for the reversibility of&amp;nbsp;capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;First, let me say that, while I hate to complain about the legnth of such a quick and short book, it could have been much shorter; It seems as though Ms. Wood felt the need or the desire&amp;#8211;depending upon her arrogance, I suppose&amp;#8211; to make a point and then spend five to ten  pages repeating&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, aftern  noticing on the back that the cover design to my verson is attributed to  &amp;#8221;random&amp;#8221;, I noticed that it really is.  At least Webber&amp;#8217;s book has a picture of the proto-protestant on its&amp;nbsp;cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, I really like the Idea of capitalism being essentially a social event, such as Brenner and Thompson present.  Wealth seems to have gone from serving a practical and social purpose (first, stability then the acquisition of luxury items) to becoming the purpose of effort; which may or may not be the defintion of&amp;nbsp;capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to my point: I take issue with what appears to be her definition of Capitalism and what I believe to be the general definition of capitalism. The Capitalist ethic, most people might agree, is that a person uses an advantage in a product&amp;#8211;whether it be a surplus or even simple availability&amp;#8211; to sell for more then it cost to acquire or produce. Her alienation of worker efficiency from &amp;#8220;extra-economic&amp;#8221; advantages&amp;#8211; or the separation of &amp;#8220;market&amp;#8221; and  &amp;#8221;Markets&amp;#8221;, which seems to imply that competitive advantage is eliminated once the technology of transportation is eliminated and causes people to look for another advantage&amp;#8211;  allows her to make a social point about the all-inclusive nature of capitalism  but removes perhaps the &amp;#8220;spirit&amp;#8221; of common capitalist critique. Morally speaking (and I am not saying she is making a moral point) ,  Capitalism then becomes not just the evil of greed but instead is just the evil of exploitation; I am not sure the difference is so&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;This was a heavy read, but the overall message I truly appreciated.  The point of the book was to challenge the sweeping general theories of the Capitalist World System, Labor, and peasantries by using Africa and Latin America as the case examples to how the system doesn&amp;#8217;t fit.  I enjoyed how the creation of the world capitalist system was done by historians who did not engage in &amp;#8220;issues of anthropology and social science, language and literature, and &amp;#8216;native&amp;#8217; worlds of knowledge and scholarship.&amp;#8221;  The ignoring of  these schools of thought by what the book often refers to as &amp;#8220;north atlantic historians&amp;#8221; failed to point out that agrarian society vs industrialized society don&amp;#8217;t fit Capitalism World System.  Peasantry resistance to Capitalism essentially denied the Capitalist World System with use of flight, banditry, refusal to produce cash crops by returning to subsistence farming and sabotage of cash crops.  When the authors analyze the Latin American and African contexts, the Capitalism World System simply doesn&amp;#8217;t fit the complexities of non-western&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;I must admit that this book was a little difficult to get through; I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of economic history or Marxist theory.  Even though the work seemed to deal largely with peasant movements, it still had that feel of economics about it, which I find sometimes difficult to understand and often hard to become engaged with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I did like the focus on peasants as individuals and the idea that we must study peoples as singular units instead of lumping them together.  Though I do not have a background in economic historical theory, it seems to me that the world-systems theory does subsume many people and cultures into the desire to create a label and a paradigm, which likely is not as universal as it wants to be.  Stern&amp;#8217;s discussion of the Potosi silver mine was an insightful dismantling of Wallerstein&amp;#8217;s thesis, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly enjoyed Isaacman and Roseberry&amp;#8217;s essays, perhaps because they did not concentrate on the historiography and the theory quite as much (or perhaps their essays were just longer, so the theory took up proportionately less space), areas with which I&amp;#8217;m not familiar.  They seemed more engaged with the actual history and with presenting concrete examples, along the lines of Stern&amp;#8217;s Potosi mine, to illustrate/discredit the theories they were discussing.  I would have liked for some of Isaacman&amp;#8217;s information to have been more developed; it felt at times as though he was slinging snippets of data at the reader to prove his point by the sheer number of examples he could use.  Roseberry&amp;#8217;s section was very good at pointing out that Marxism often doesn&amp;#8217;t consider the agrarian peasant&amp;#8212;it focuses on the wage-worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Amanda has said, when I began reading the book, I was expecting the authors to be blatantly anti-Marx.  Instead, they seem to accept some of his basic ideas, but with some modifications, specifically the need to address groups individually instead of universally.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6220711600267285330-5268581806969153722?l=jawhite21.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;        I think the organization of this book added to its effectiveness. As outlined in the introduction, each essay looked primarily at a specific historical paradigm relating to the study of Latin America or Africa. I agree that placing Africa and Latin America side-by-side added to the study, as certain similarities and differences in past scholarly assumptions were highlighted. The introduction sets up the splintering of traditional modes of thought about Latin American and African studies nicely; rooting it in various experiences of the 1960&amp;#8217;s and 70&amp;#8217;s, while still noting earlier examples. This book now deals with further changes in scholarship, starting from the 1980&amp;#8217;s. I though Stern&amp;#8217;s argument against viewing Latin American economics as either the result of feudalism or capitalism was very persuasive; it is clear that neither alone suffices. Cooper&amp;#8217;s evaluation of the changes in African scholarship were the most interesting essay to me. It is somewhat embarrassing how many scholars in the past dismissed African history entirely. This necessitated a generation of scholars that affirmed African uniqueness, but there was still more work to be done. As Cooper states, &amp;#8220;that Africans had their own points of view and their own history was revealing only to people who believed they did not. A new generation of students took that point for granted and found that Africanists offered no particular set of questions and theoretical issues.&amp;#8221;(85) Coopers addendum to his original work was also interesting, to see how scholarship has progressed, and I think his point that &amp;#8220;underdevelopment&amp;#8221; leads one to think there is a point of normalcy in other nation&amp;#8217;s developments that Africans are behind, is very well taken(196). It is always interesting how certain biases seem to come back around, even from historians with good intentions.&lt;br /&gt;
    Isaacman looks at how the study of peasants voices has progressed; its insight and its potential difficulties. It is certainly true that misinterpretation, either culturally or language-based, is a potent danger for scholars or varying experience dealing with unofficial reports of the people at large, who many times have shared vocabulary and mutual understandings unique to them(225). The essay then looks at studies of how peasant lives changed under capitalism, and peasant accounts are a vital record to these and other studies. The book then shifts back to Latin American was Roseberry&amp;#8217;s essay, who looks at peasants, as well. I think this essay was wise to come last(besides the conclusion), because it notes the scholarship already contained in the book and expands off of it. Finally, the concluding essay nicely ties the essays back together with certain themes and areas of future research. This was an impressive bit of scholarship. While it must be admitted that it is probably not intriguing or necessarily accessible to the casual history reader, for our study of the study of history, it was very&amp;nbsp;helpful. &lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m going to attempt to do less summarizing and more opinion oriented blog posts on the books from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually really enjoyed this book. The essays really tear into modern Marxist conceptions of the world-system. I enjoy seeing universalist concepts being overthrown, because there are no absolutes in history. The region by region analysis of the capitalist world-system, pointing out a hundred exceptions to it, very effectively tears a hole in the entire concept. The world-system is revealed to be a very, very small world, consisting mostly of Europe, North America, and prosperous Asia, with Africa and Latin America being shown to not fit in with the neat conceptions. The African examples were, to me, even more powerful than the Latin American ones, which used a number of modes of production and had their own economic platform, but were still practicing capitalist forms of economic practice. In Africa, on the other hand, &amp;#8220;peasants&amp;#8221; among others actively and successfully resisted incorporation into the capitalist world-system. The capitalist model is neither universal nor inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chapter on peasants in Africa was my favorite. I like resistance stories anyway, and a description of the systems by which the &amp;#8220;peasants&amp;#8221; resisted integration through everything from flight to banditry, and refusing to partake in cash crop economy by returning to subsistence farming. The Latin American segment afterwards reinforces, to me, the fact that Marxism doesn&amp;#8217;t take into account the agrarian world nearly enough, a fact Mao and Lenin tried to incorporate in their own ways, though their theories are failed ones in my opinion as well. Agrarian societies are so far out of the scope of the industrialized world that Westerners don&amp;#8217;t know what to do with them—or at least the Marxist world-system doesn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if the world-system breaks down when you look outside of the industrialized world, what does that leave us? Is Marxism invalid? I think economic superstructure is still a valid jumping off point, but the progression of universal capitalism into socialism seems to be pretty much not true.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-1188981670015062787?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Confronting Historical Paradigms, Cooper et&amp;nbsp;al.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall thrust of Confronting Historical Paradigms, is that the established analytical frameworks of history are inherently ethnocentric in that they are generated by a capitalist culture (either directly or by way of a response to it) that ultimately force native populations into foreign universal paradigms without regard to cultural applicability.  A prime example is the Marxist envisioning of peasants in Africa and Latin American as members of the European proletariat.  Generalization is classified as a useful tool, but this comes with an important caveat: in evaluating history the world system must not be seen as the most important factor, it must be carefully balanced with accounts of local cultures, peoples, and governments (which may defy linear metanarratives).  Thus, the authors deconstruct the monolithic world system, arguing that it is actually defined by a multitude of local factors and&amp;nbsp;experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ethnocentric paradigms were difficult to give up, and scholars searched for ways to force their evaluations into the structure of existing paradigms.  By the 1980s &amp;#8220;a series of &amp;#8216;post-isms&amp;#8217; and events in the Third and socialist worlds all contributed to blowing most paradigmatic lids off permanently.&amp;#8221;  In arguing that foreign or ethnocentric structures are no longer valid, the book suggests that academic openness is the key to preventing similar forced evaluations in the future.  The goal is to keep the avenues of debate open to human agency, regionalism or localism, and to include as many different perspectives as&amp;nbsp;possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not perfect, when taken as a whole, the book provides a good framework for understanding the development of the different conceptual structures western scholars have used to examine non-western and colonial cultures.  Such a discussion cannot help but reveal the misconceptions created by such a system or the historical blinders it places on academics evaluating these periods and places.  Thus, while I dislike the book&amp;#8217;s organization because I feel it presents a lack of continuity, it was a useful&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;It seems to be the same pattern with each of the texts I read.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;In the course of learning what the author is attempting to elucidate, I get a secondary education in words and authors.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This go-round, I learned words like reification and obfuscation, which are nearly opposite.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I got to learn about Wallerstein&amp;#8217;s core, structural-functionalism, African agency, modernization theory, underdevelopment theory, and modes of production analysis. The five authors cover these topics very deeply with examples and case studies, and enough notes and references to make another book.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Seriously, Chapter 4 alone was 60 pages long, and then had 54 pages of notes/references to back up what Isaacman wrote about peasants in Africa.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;I won&amp;#8217;t rehash a synopsis of the book, but a couple things stood out to me.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;First, all the authors seem as if they are covering time-frames in African and Latin American history from a capitalist-Marxist viewpoint. They are following what is happening in these areas as the people move with fits, sputters, trials, and tribulations toward capitalism.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Isaacman refers to all these attempts at labeling and studying such changes as paradigms. (209)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The peasants, slaves, workers, and various other non-elite characters are viewed as they go about resisting capital&amp;#8217;s control, thwarting capital&amp;#8217;s advance into their life – forcing changes they do not want.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Second, they are critiquing and expounding ideas of others in light of new research of themselves and others and recent &amp;#8216;paradigm&amp;#8217; shifts.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Mostly they advocate listening to the peasant voices, both from oral histories and those hidden within written records of the controlling political powers.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt;&#34;&gt;My problem with all this is that these authors are trying to place all of this within the context of a capitalist-Marxist world view.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I feel that both Africa and Latin America, and even North America and Asia for that matter, are areas that developed for millennia outside the European sphere.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Asia in the form of China and Japan achieved a written language long before the others, including Europe, and even the Mesoamerican empires of the Mayan, Inca, and Aztecs had their own form of written communication.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Asia is touched upon at the end of the book as a reference, and the author did start on hegemony, (388-9) but they did not go that much deeper.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The main idea that leaps out at me is that the European nations exercised the idea of &amp;#8216;might makes right&amp;#8217; over established nations who could not match them militaristically, or better as the right of conquest.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;China was able to withstand their onslaught until the opium wars I think, when the British used their military to broker a business deal the Chinese were unwilling to make.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Africa and Latin America did not have such a large unifying government like the Chinese.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The Aztecs were close militarily until disease reduced their numbers and their vassals decided to deal with the Spanish – that really turned out well for them.&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;When I first began reading &lt;i&gt;Confronting Historical Paradigms&lt;/i&gt;, I&amp;nbsp; expected to encounter a strong anti-Marxian critique that systematically proved the fallibility of his economic and historical theory. What is actually contained within this book is much different and, to my surprise, much more enjoyable. Taken as a whole, the book would be somewhat lengthy and difficult to slough through due to the detailed information contained within its pages. It is clear that each contributing author is intimately familiar with their particular subject and that knowledge comes through in sometimes overwhelming force. Fortunately, &lt;i&gt;Confronting Historical Paradigms&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of individual essays confronting the imposition of dominant historical paradigms onto non-Western countries and arguing for the advent of new paradigms that allow for greater variability. The book&amp;#8217;s division into self-contained chapters makes it much easier to get through, as well as keeping it interesting by providing several different opinions on the same general topic. Overall, I found this book to be engaging, thought-provoking and above all persuasive in its claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the first main chapter of the book, that by Steve Stern, to be one of the most interesting sections. His focus on Latin America highlighted many of the limitations of Marxian economic theory when applied to non-Western countries, particularly through the two case studies he provides. I also found his critique of other systematic historical paradigms to be rather enlightening, notably his critical assessment of Wallerstein&amp;#8217;s theory of a world system. I found myself in complete agreement with his assertion that history is simply too complex and varied to be explained with a single paradigm. This is even more true when that paradigm is derived from the experiences of Western Europe and then forcibly applied elsewhere, regardless of applicability. This section once again emphasized the Euro-centric aspect of much historical scholarship and the limitations of such a development. Stern does a convincing job at explaining why existing historical paradigms are insufficient for some areas of historical study, although he does not really provide a valid alternative. Marxist theory in particular does not work because, according to Stern, his system does not incorporate all aspects of historical life, such as peasants and peasantries. A more specific approach is needed to truly understand Latin American history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The chapter by Frederick Cooper on Africa and the World Economy was also rather enjoyable, although a little more difficult to get through due to the huge amount of information compressed into a few pages. Thankfully, Cooper provides a brief overview of the three primary historical paradigms used for studying African history, a decision I appreciated as someone who is somewhat unfamiliar with theoretical studies of Africa. Cooper main contention against existing paradigms differed from Sterns; Cooper argues that these models do not provide a deep enough analysis and such questions as why, for whom and at who&amp;#8217;s expense need to be addressed more thoroughly. Cooper does not have an issue with looking at Africa as a whole; in fact, he asserts that is it appropriate to study Africa in context with the world economy because of its undeniable influence on African history. However, whatever system is used needs to be more flexible than those in existence. According to Cooper, and I found myself in full agreement, the Marxist system is too mechanical and does not allow for changes and variances. I was particularly interested in his section on the different development rates of capitalism and how some precursors actually hindered its development. I think one of his biggest criticisms of Marx, although he does not come out and say this, rests with the impersonal nature of Marxist history. His theory simply does not allow for much human agency, particularly on the part of peasants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 4 by Allen Isaacman focuses almost exclusively on the difficult role of placing peasants in history. I found Isaacman&amp;#8217;s defense for greater incorporation of peasant studies to be persuasive. For me, at least, this chapter was also just an enjoyable and interesting read from the very beginning with his discussion on the complications involved in the term peasant. I was also surprised to find a strong Foucaultian influence throughout this section as well, although after reading it I believe that this particular approach was an excellent decision and added a great deal of depth to his argument. It was interesting to think about peasants not as a unified class, but as a much more complex social group that experienced both interclass and intraclass struggles. Isaacman also made a good point in his explanation for the history of peasant studies and the changes it has undergone in recent years as well as some of its limitations: evidence. The type of evidence a historian utilizes determines to a great extent&amp;nbsp; what conclusions will be drawn. In stark contrast to Marx, Isaacman believes that it is necessary to use a much more localized approach to historical study; he believes there are simply too many variations and anomalies within peasant life for a single system to apply. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last main chapter of the book, that by William Roseberry, was my least favorite. Although he made some interesting points, I did not enjoy his approach as much those taken by the other authors. He provided a thorough examination of the &lt;i&gt;structure&lt;/i&gt; of agrarian questions rather than looking at some of the questions and their results, which I would have been more interested in on a personal level. Theoretically, however, this section was enlightening and certainly expanded my appreciation for agrarian history. Like Roseberry, I would agree that agrarian history should be incorporated within the larger historical narrative in order to provide a more complete picture. One of the most interesting points of Roseberry&amp;#8217;s argument was his critique of Marxist theory. He argues, correctly I believe, that the dominance of Marxist history has pervaded history to the point that many scholars do not question the application of his ideas and categories. These categories, however, are not always appropriate and are certainly not applicable to Latin American peasantries. It is wrong for them to be lumped into a class context against a capitalist versus non-capitalist background, for this particular approach fails to accurately grasp the nature of agrarian societies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This books was both an interesting, enjoyable and insightful read. It was refreshing to see so many convincing arguments against the Marxist theory, particularly ones that provided what I believe to be a fuller historical approach. I also enjoyed the variance of ideas proposed within the book&amp;#8217;s pages; instead of one critique expounded upon by contributing authors, each provided an individual refutement of Marxist ideas based upon knowledge of their particular subject. For me, this made the book much more engaging and, I think, convincing overall. I put &lt;i&gt;Confronting Historical Paradigms&lt;/i&gt; down conscious of the importance of regionalized variations, the importance of human agency and the many ways in which different historical paradigms interact to propel new advancements in the methodological approach to historical study.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-3908440234912937521?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Once again we have a long-winded book full of so many trees I can&amp;#8217;t enjoy the forest.  My favorite part of the entire 400 pages was the bit about the women resisting expectations to create erosion control, because I can totally identify.  I don&amp;#8217;t like economics, I don&amp;#8217;t understand economics, and I&amp;#8217;m tired, tired, tired of spending days and days of my life trying to decipher interminable monographs about economics.  It takes so much effort just to find the gist of their articles that I have no energy, time, or motivation left to evaluate or synthesize them.  So, here&amp;#8217;s my hard-won summary, but that is as far as I can go.  I have had it with this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter one, by Steve Stern, introduced the theme that recent scholarship has evolved away from grand narratives to more localized and specific studies.  This seems like splintering and loss, but opens up the possibility of discussions and resonances.  It put me in mind of the step from singing in unison to parts—it&amp;#8217;s difficult and confusing at first, but eventually yields much richer and more beautiful music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter two, also by Steve Stern, evaluated Wallerstein&amp;#8217;s theories in light of Latin American evidence.  Wallerstein said we have to look at the whole world as a system, the core/semi-periphery/periphery have different labor styles, labor methods determine political possibilities, and capitalism finds the best combination of free and coerced labor.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Stern tried these out for the silver industry, he found that various labor relations existed concurrently, and while Latin America&amp;#8217;s silver affected the world as expected Wallerstein&amp;#8217;s theories didn&amp;#8217;t explain the world&amp;#8217;s effect on Latin America.  In order to explain Latin American development, you need to include local power sources and their goals, and peasants&amp;#8217; resistance to becoming wage laborers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the sugar industry showed weaknesses in the periphery equals slavery idea, because slavery was only resorted to after other labor systems didn&amp;#8217;t work, and even within a system of slavery, there were bits of autonomy and accumulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the grand theory didn&amp;#8217;t hold up to focused, detailed, specific examples, because they offered too much variety for a generalized system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter three, the longest and most irritating, was written by Frederick Cooper, who seriously needs some time in a journalism class.  Brevity and succinctness are good things, though apparently very elusive in academic writing.  First, he looked at different grand theories, and how they fared against evidence in Africa.  Neo-Classical scholars have a single model, only one idea for rational motivation so when Africa didn&amp;#8217;t fit it was seen as inadequacy in Africa, and a focus on markets and products instead of the structures and people who influenced them.  Dependence and Underdevelopment models look at a core that drains surplus from the periphery, and define periphery as where surplus is drained from, so end up saying nothing.  Cooper says they have a good idea, but it&amp;#8217;s too crude and general to provide useful insights.  Marxism looks at production instead of markets, and says capitalism didn&amp;#8217;t develop in Africa because they couldn&amp;#8217;t eliminate alternatives to wage labor because about the same time efficiency would have become necessary, transportation advances made the status quo a better option, so no class was able to accumulate enough to begin the capitalist cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he looked at events across time.  In Gold to Slaves he said that slavery was a method of controlling the populace in addition to being a source of funds and power, and it didn&amp;#8217;t require excluding others from resources so it didn&amp;#8217;t lead to the accumulation necessary to start capitalism.  In Slaves to Peanuts, he looked at merchant capital and their need for peace instead of the violence that had supported the slave trade.  Imperialists had as much trouble controlling the populace as African leaders had had, so once again, capitalism didn&amp;#8217;t develop as the theories had predicted.  In Agriculture and the Colonial State he looked at many attempts to corral the African people into their role as wage laborers and how those attempts have failed.  Local leaders only knew domination and plunder, so they weren&amp;#8217;t good partners; the enforced peace gave workers new options to avoid becoming wage laborers, and they consistently preferred food crops and autonomy to cash crops and subjection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he provided many more pages of examples of ways Africa didn&amp;#8217;t fit the tidy European model of Marxism.  His basic point is that Africa has too much available land and too much peasant resistance for the standard sequence to work.  Capital in Africa has had to create new goals and strategies in order to salvage any kind of success. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His conclusion was—shockingly—that previous ideologies had imposed our schemata on African situations, but since Africans have different circumstances and priorities, European ideas don&amp;#8217;t support their history.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter four, by Allen Isaacman, was about peasants in Africa.  They resisted colonialism&amp;#8217;s imposition of commodity production in a variety of ways, based on the different circumstances and positions of each sort of peasant.  After looking at some examples of this resistance, he considered acts of retribution, a la Robin Hood.  These made statements, and relieved resentment, and occasionally led to policy changes.  Songs, jokes and other cultural contributions provided a perception and identity that supported actual acts of subversion and so are also a form of resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He looked at conflicts within peasant communities as well as peasants against rulers, though even here he said that the imposition of colonial/capitalist expectations intensified those conflicts in many ways.  As young people and females resisted elders and males, they got experience and confidence to resist other forms of power.  Organized political resistance developed when everyday forms of subversion were no longer possible.  A good area for study is how peasants act to organize their resources for these concerted rebellions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter five, by William Roseberry, looked at peasants in Latin America, and how research has evolved over the years.  In the 1960s people asked questions about the peasants instead of considering questions of the peasants, which cast them as props or victims instead of as actors.  Researchers lumped all peasants together as those oppressed by colonial powers, and assumed some recent upset that had instigated the current upheaval and suffering.  These sweeping universals ignored varieties and missed insights that come from closer, deeper looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historians and anthropologists each have something to contribute to the study of peasants in Latin America.  As they communicate and swap ideas, they&amp;#8217;ve come to a regional focus that allows a good balance of specificity ad connection, and also uncovers new sources of data.  Looking at variations in haciendas and coffee production has already produced new insights and led to new questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He concludes by saying that studies need &amp;#8220;historical and sociological content&amp;#8221; (359) in order to substantiate their conclusions and theories, and gives evidence that this is beginning to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter six, by Florencia Mallon, summarized and synthesized the other chapters, and called for the next big idea.  She said there had been two scholarly revolutions within her career, the one in the 70&amp;#8217;s moving from world to local, and the one in the late 80&amp;#8217;s going from communities to sub-groups like feminism and such.  They&amp;#8217;ve both challenged previous assumptions and over-generalizations, which was helpful, but they&amp;#8217;ve left scholars with no way to organize their findings.  Now it&amp;#8217;s time to find new theories and structures to guide inquiry, but this time these scaffolds need to be written in pencil as supports instead of in pen as mental cages.  After a whole book that showed the inadequacies of overarching ideas, she ended by saying that researchers can&amp;#8217;t just eliminate structures because they&amp;#8217;re the way to turn discrete data from particular cases into coherent narratives that provide insight and significance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she spent some time comparing various studies and articles to show how their differences could inform and strengthen each other.  She added subaltern ideas from India as another source of perspectives that would strengthen productive dialogues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after 400 pages, we have: old over-generalized theories don&amp;#8217;t work in Africa and Latin America.  Once researchers looked at specifics they found more exceptions and variations, and so they need new ways to consider their data.  Communication between areas and disciplines will provide richer ideas and questions, and lead to a more elastic and accurate overarching theme.   Color me underwhelmed.  And cranky.  Obviously.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-8746498660589594256?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;In &lt;u&gt;Confronting Historical Paradigms&lt;/u&gt; by Steve J. Stern et. al., the authors provide detailed critiques of the attitudes and language employed by world systems theorists&amp;nbsp;and make suggestions for the improvement of historical analysis.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, the authors advocate taking&amp;nbsp;an approach toward&amp;nbsp;Latin and African materialist models and their affects on the individual peasantries, as opposed to earlier attempts to define a single peasantry construct.&amp;nbsp; However, they also point out that even world systems theory doesn&amp;#8217;t always apply to the European model, which was the metropole to developing peripheries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major issue with world systems theory, and its offshoots, as these authors point out, is&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;overgeneralized, even&amp;nbsp;false&amp;nbsp;classification and characterization of&amp;nbsp;peasants, as if they were the Marxist model of a European proletariat, or as if they existed as voiceless,&amp;nbsp;unchanging&amp;nbsp;shadows in a capitalist system.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The grouping of the&amp;nbsp;differing &lt;em&gt;seigneurial systems&lt;/em&gt; in Mexico and Oaxaca into one model is a prime example; as is the&amp;nbsp;differing situation of peasantries in South Africa&amp;nbsp;and the Western Sahara.&amp;nbsp; However, the authors are clear to point out that it is not wrong to place a particular group within an economic system, as long as proper care is taken to avoid the pitfalls of viewing the world system as the most important for historical analysis, as opposed to peoples, regions or states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall impression of this collection is that the authors&amp;nbsp;did an&amp;nbsp;good job&amp;nbsp;of using specific example to, not completely condemn, but explaining and break down some of the&amp;nbsp;historical misconceptions that were developed within&amp;nbsp;cultural and social mindsets&amp;nbsp;from the 1950s to the 1980s,&amp;nbsp;while offering up&amp;nbsp;positive trends&amp;nbsp;toward productive alternatives for future historical analyses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8880139849602883287-8927148508226090550?l=dixonro.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;I began the reading this week with the Marx-Engels Reader.  I read a selection and then switched to Postone&amp;#8217;s book before finishing with Marx. I am very glad I did, because I feel Postone&amp;#8217;s analysis helps express some Marxist  theories in a slightly more accessible way.  I enjoyed that selection, though it took a while to wade through, because it successfully presented Marxist  theories in a way that complemented(and occasionally challenged) more typical interpretations.  The selection from Postone dealt specifically with the Captial Vol. I section of the Marx-Engels Reader. However, I was interested to see how many of the ideas had already presented themselves in the section of &amp;#8220;German Ideology,&amp;#8221; which I had previously read.  For example, the circulation of commodities was explained in Postone&amp;#8217;s work (page 264) as &amp;#8220;a quasi-natural  network of social connections; although it lies beyond their control,&amp;#8221; based on Marx(207-09). However on page 162 of the Marx-Engels Reader, the idea of an oppressive world trade that &amp;#8220;hovers over the earth like the fate of the ancients, and with an invisible hand allots fortune and misfortune to men, sets up empires and overthrows empires, causes nations to rise and to disappear,&amp;#8221; was already introduced. This is also true of the rejection of Hegelian interpretation of history(Postone, 285; Marx 148-49, 154). This is not surprising, since these are fundamental components of Marx&amp;#8217;s worldview, and some continuity of theme would lend some fluidity to the work(if also some redundancy). However, I think it is important to note, that in all the discussion of empirical evidence to support his theories, there are certain narratives that are supported above others with a persistence that makes me wonder what evidence to the contrary may have been purposefully excluded.&lt;br /&gt;
    I was particularly interested, in reading both these works, by the divisions of concepts such as labor, value, and time, into smaller subcategories. These notions are often conflated in my own mind, so to read them as separate, though intrinsically linked, entities was very intriguing as a way to broaden my own analysis of history. The one I was especially interested in was the multiple divisions of the concept of time, and further how these separate components of time impact value. I think the argument is particularly strong when it discusses the notion that &amp;#8220;value is an expression of time in the present.&amp;#8221;(Postone, 296) The argument that as advancements become generalized, they are no longer seen as advancements, but become the new baseline of normal production can certainly be seen in our society to this day, and it promotes the idea of perpetual need for growth and a directional nature of development expressed elsewhere in the work. I am glad to have read more about Marxist philosophy, rather than the abridged versions I have dealt with in the past that discussed only the need for revolution. While certainly prevalent throughout the Marx-Engels reader, these arguments are much more complex and intriguing than simply the high school summary  of &amp;#8220;capitalism is corrupt, workers unite!&amp;#8221; to which I was first&amp;nbsp;introduced.   &lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Socialism, communism, Marxism. These ideologies, as grounded in the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, unquestionably changed the world. They were espoused by forces of political revolution in Russia and China, which in turn spread/imposed those ideals within their spheres of influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An overly simplistic summation, certainly, but it gets to the heart of a notion that for decades was embraced by the &amp;#8220;the Iron Curtain&amp;#8221; and feared by the capitalistic West.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly, Marx&amp;#8217;s words leave no doubt as to the mutual exclusivity of those two worlds. As he wrote in &amp;#8220;Wage Labour and Capital,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;(E)very social reform remains a utopia until the proletarian revolution and the feudalistic counter-revolution measure swords in a world war.&amp;#8221; Scary stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That &amp;#8220;real movement which abolishes the present state of things&amp;#8221; (as described in &amp;#8220;The German Ideology&amp;#8221;) was to represent &amp;#8220;an act of the dominant peoples &amp;#8216;all at once,&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; leading ultimately to a classless society. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds good – in theory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for all their expounding of economic principles, for all their historical ruminations, for all their cynicism, Marx and Engels display remarkable naivete as regards human nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it is that the Soviet Union and Red China cannot be said to represent anything even close to a true &amp;#8220;dictatorship of the proletariat.&amp;#8221; So it is that the former, economically and morally bankrupt, collapsed in the early 1990s. So it is that the latter, with its billion-plus consumers, has become quite willing to do business with, and to a growing extent emulate, the capitalist world (although one wonders if this phenomenon could to some extent play into Lenin&amp;#8217;s prediction that &amp;#8220;The Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them&amp;#8221;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, Marx wrote that &amp;#8220;We shall try to make our presentation as simple and popular as possible&amp;#8221; (&amp;#8220;Wage Labour and Capital&amp;#8221;). The extent to which he and Engels succeeded in this regard is debatable. But Postone&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Time, Labor, and Social Domination: A Reinterpretation of Marx&amp;#8217;s Critical Theory&amp;#8221; does little to further the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By and large, and perhaps of necessity, Postone merely restates Marx&amp;#8217;s ideas in different words. He occasionally does offer interesting elaboration or clarification. But original insights seem few and far between. Among them, however, is his assertion that &amp;#8220;Marx&amp;#8217;s conception of the social relations constituted in the sphere of production cannot be understood solely in terms of class relations of exploitation.&amp;#8221;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8399157107533224051-2923881771173840174?l=bumpusjournal.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Marx says,&lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;The relations of production in their totality constitute what is called the social relations, society, and, moreover, a society at a definite stage of historical development, a society with peculiar, distinctive characteristics. Ancient society, feudal society, bourgeois (or capitalist) society, is such totalities of relations of production, each of which denotes a particular stage of development in the history of&amp;nbsp;mankind.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:normal;&#34;&gt;He is boiling down society in history to mere production of goods or commodities.  Now as a historian in training I will not deny the importance of economy in politics(arguably they are mirror images), a great deal of events throughout history can be attributed to economic standpoints, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HOWEVER&lt;/span&gt;, the fact that he ignores the affects of culture is simply repulsive.  Culture which in my view is intimately tied with Religion has had great impact in history weighing in as much as economics in the course of&amp;nbsp;time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a Medievalist, I cannot deny that individuals or classes in the medieval period acted for economic gain, however i cannot also deny that they did not believe in the religious righteousness of their actions.  An example would be the Crusades.  European Crusaders fought for the Holy Land for many reasons, Economic, Political and Cultural. Marx&amp;#8217;s seemingly economic extreme denies that any individual would do anything without attaining some sort of commodity in&amp;nbsp;return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postone explained &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;the circulation of commodities overcomes the temporal, spatial, and personal barriers imposed by the direct exchange of products.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;This might be what Marx said but it&amp;#8217;s does not take into account how Culture resisted and denied the circulation of commodities in certain places and times.  China and Japan resisted global markets out of cultural reasons and were only brought to the fold of globalization after invasion or coercion by global powers.  Marx never fully appreciates the power of culture and its imposition on economics itself! He always assumes it goes the other way&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;div id=&#34;_mcePaste&#34;&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always heard that Marx was a good historian (sometimes this would be replaced with philosopher) who was a terrible fortune teller. I think, in a large way, those impressions were right.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a lot to good to say about Marx. There are many who dismiss him simply because Communism failed in eastern Europe. That is, however, short sighted.  While many of the compliments thrown his way are summed up best when Foucault called him a &amp;#8220;founder of discursivity&amp;#8221;, it seems prescient to reiterate just how influential his work was: even those who disagree with him are forced, in essence, to speak his language.  However, I believe where the true dissonance appears between Marx and his detractors appears when we fail to recognize the social conditions of his day. It seems Marx had an odd connection with the Romantics for a man who disagreed so much with non-concrete or non-empirical evidence.  I wonder, too, if the Romantics on a fundamental level were more successful than Marx in actively engaged change. The &amp;#8220;Communists&amp;#8221; Marx speaks of&amp;#8211; who require revolution&amp;#8211; in one sense came before Marx in the form of Blake and Byron. They are separated now not only through history but ideologically (though both are generally and anachronistically placed on the left) in how they attempted change; for the Romantics usually fought localized wars and battles while Communists had a more global&amp;nbsp;aim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, these are anachronistic comparisons. Certainly, the horrors of everyday life (especially for the poor) we made all the more ghastly by the machine&amp;#8217;s which Marx writes of, both in terms of poverty and in real violence and accidents.  Certainly, the world in which the totalitarian governments who ostensibly claimed his philosophy operated   offered an even more dangerous method&amp;nbsp;of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marx, I think, would have shuddered in fear and hatred at the government which came to be associated with his philosophy thought nothing of the people. And, perhaps, thats where the implementation of his philosophy failed: as his philosophy  was born with a bent toward a consciousness based purely on physical conditions, he left too little room for the human element to stand as a last line of defense against&amp;nbsp;atrocity.&lt;/p&gt;

(165)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Marx explores location as important in the production of historical consciousness.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The French and English follow political illusion, but the Germans operate on religious illusion; the Hegelian philosophy.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This is where the starting point of history is, the religious man puts the production of fancies in place of the means of subsistence and of life itself.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Marx seems more anti-religious than anything else.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Not just with the religious &amp;#8220;fancies,&amp;#8221; but also in saying that the &amp;#8220;realm of God&amp;#8221; existed only in the imagination. (166)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 9.0pt;&#34;&gt;I like his definition of an historical product – the result of the activity of a whole succession of generations, each standing on the shoulders of the preceding one.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I would also agree with him that the nature that preceded human history is the nature which no longer exists today. (170,171)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 9.0pt;&#34;&gt;The basis of ideology: town vs. country/ burgher vs. lord / laborer vs. serf&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 9.0pt;&#34;&gt;The town provided order, defense, and a political association.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This was the beginning of the separation of capital and landed gentry.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;In the towns, capital was from individuals; the merchants emerged as the separation between production and commerce.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The burgher&amp;#8217;s ability to organize their town for defense and to link it with other towns for information and trade raised their class against the nobility.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;After feudalism had succumbed, the guilds were the new threat to this new class of elites.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The merchants led to the manufacturers who could produce in quantity for large markets.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;This in turn led to big industry and world markets, which Marx claims as the beginning of world history. (185) From this we see capitalists appear along with the working class, proletariats.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Marx&amp;#8217;s main idea though is communism, where the individual subjects the material power and abolishes the division of labor. &lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;So then, the proletariat must overthrow the state to assert itself. (197,200)&amp;nbsp; With all this going on, you can see why the Germanic area was also the physical battleground of Europe as well as the philosophical.&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 9.0pt;&#34;&gt;I do not know why the feminist movement did not latch onto Engels during the Women&amp;#8217;s Lib era.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;His findings that women were the main power manipulators of ancient times should have been a major attraction.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;That men forced themselves to the head for economic reason should only re-enforce women&amp;#8217;s sense of disfranchisement, when he claimed the first class oppression as being the female sex by the male. (739)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It would seem that Engels is very down on marriage, at least the monogamous kind.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;His belief that only oppressed people can have a truly loving relationship seems more politically created rhetoric.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;In his struggle with the capitalist class, Engels appears as if he is trying to place a seed of doubt in the minds of the ruling class by questioning their true loyalty to even their marriage partner.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Perhaps this is where the idea of a pre-nuptial agreement came into being.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;He further tries to bring the children into the fray with the idea that their greedy parental units could easily disinherit them because they did not like them.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;If I forget, ask me in class about my personal knowledge of this.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Back on point; he does come back to the notion that true sex love is marriage, and it is by nature monogamous.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 9.0pt;&#34;&gt;Engels history of the State is quite insightful.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Why the original association of peoples, the need to protect their territory, the need to organize society and maintain order.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Why taxes are actually necessary – proper use of the revenues gained is an entirely different and very long discussion.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34; style=&#34;margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 9.0pt;&#34;&gt;The political power and class control the State provides allude to the change in purpose it has undergone while in operation.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;That politics is co-opted by the producers of wealth for the protection of their agenda is to say that the workers are being pushed out of a place that is rightfully theirs.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;His closing call for equality, brotherhood, and universal education are a hopeful note on which&amp;nbsp;to end.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Like some other people, I certainly found Marx easier to read than Hegel.  Having never read any of Marx&amp;#8217;s own writings before, and only being familiar with his ideas through the filter of media and education, I was excited to actually read what he wrote.  I appreciated his, at least intended, approach to discuss his views in terms of &amp;#8220;materialism,&amp;#8221; that is, real people, real events, and real phenomena; as opposed to starting with the Ideal of consciousness and trying to relate that back to humanity.  However, as I read through the sections, I couldn&amp;#8217;t help but think that at times, Marx himself veered off into Ideals.  Yes, everything was couched in terms of linen, coats, workers, bees, and use-values, but it&amp;#8217;s still all very theoretical and full of supposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found his small sections about labor conditions the most interesting, given the appalling lack of safe conditions in factories at the time; it was noteworthy, though, that Marx didn&amp;#8217;t seem to really advance any concrete ideas toward fixing the problems, beyond reiterating how awful/unfair the capitalistic society that had created the conditions was.  Also noteworthy was the way in which Marx saw the capitalistic overlords as the descendants of medieval feudal lords, thus making the wage-laborer, who sells his body, in a sense, the descendant of serfs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout, some of his terminology was difficult to latch onto, and I found myself having to flip back to previous sections to remember definitions.  At times, I wondered whether all his theories would just fall apart (beyond what we know of Communism today) if the terms were defined slightly differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I was struck by how much the Communist theory pervaded everything in society, in Marx&amp;#8217;s view.  I especially noticed this in the &amp;#8220;Origin of Family&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; section, in which historically the wife became the proletariat.  Despite what we know about current theories regarding the potential matrilineal nature of some early civilizations, I didn&amp;#8217;t find anything in Marx, per se, that gave evidence toward this.  There was simply an assertion that it was so, before linking the idea of the subjugation of women with the oppression of the worker.  It made me wonder what Marx/Engels thought about women&amp;#8217;s suffrage, or if the idea was postulated simply to further their economic ideas.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6220711600267285330-8331981202776207135?l=jawhite21.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Historical materialism operates from the fundamental assessment that history itself is not the collective actions and motives of individuals or groups, but that history is the collective tale of how mankind creates and recreates the material requirements of life.  Indeed, the only thing that serves to separate man from the lower animals is the ability to produces the means of survival.  In order to carry out the production of the means of survival, people enter into a society governed by their interactions regarding the means of production.  Therefore, history is driven by the social context of communal living—more precisely the economics of&amp;nbsp;production. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social structure—the context of community—presupposes a larger superstructure known as the state in which serves to enforce the communal good over the individual good and regulate the interactions of production.  Ultimately this generates a group consciousness, but this group consciousness is removed from the individual and exists only as a part of his interactions with other men and serves to delude him into accepting his&amp;nbsp;plight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As society develops, the relations of production become more complex, but they are firmly rooted in a growing division of labor and control of production by outside forces.  By the time capitalism emerges, civilization as moved beyond slavery and feudal serfdom, but the control of production is tightly controlled by capitalists, who are the heirs to feudal lords, as they privately own the means of production and commerce.  The more refined the system of production becomes, the more stratified society becomes and the smaller the class of controllers of production becomes.   The producers are reduced to wage laborers who exchange their energy for a meager subsistence represented by the artificial value of money which is exchanged for the means of survival, thus creating wage&amp;nbsp;slaves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principles of Marxist history seem to be easily broken down to a few simple tenets: (1) human society is based on the production of the means of subsistence, (2) the division of labor generates social classes based on type of labor performed, (3) production is based on the technology available, and (4) society evolves over time with modes of production and will eventually end in a socialist state.  Within this framework, then, history is relegated to class conflict, wherein the produces are continually struggling against those who own the means of production.   Society can only evolve when the lower classes challenge the superstructure of society.  The end result is revolution in favor of the&amp;nbsp;proletariat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one were to sum up Marx&amp;#8217;s theory of history in a single sentence it might read thus: history is the story of class conflict over the means of production.  According to Marx, civilization develops along a set path determined by the technology of production and the relationship between producers and owners of production.  Ultimately, Marx postulates that this path will eventually lead to a socialist revolution.   Does this mean, then that Marxist history is utopian in its outlook?  How is this truly different from the Universal History of Kant and&amp;nbsp;Hegel? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hegel suggests that the central arc of history is to be found in the freedom of the spirit; that history is the study of freedom with given cultures.  Freedom, Hegel, asserts begins as a privilege of despots, which is transferred to a privilege of the few, and ultimately ends in a widespread realization that humanity is free in and of itself (a civilization wherein all enjoy liberty).   Kant suggests that the driving force of history is found in reason.  He suggests that history can be seen as the realization of Nature&amp;#8217;s plan for perfection.  Thus, Kant says history is the story of progress towards an unknown, but rational&amp;nbsp;future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we ignore Kant&amp;#8217;s valorization of an unknown future state and Hegel&amp;#8217;s conception of freedom as best enforced within constitutional monarchies, what difference is to be found as one moves towards Marx?  Marx necessarily supposes a universal history rooted in progress towards what he believes to be the realization of freedom.  Therein Marx incorporates both Hegelian and Kantian theories of history—progress and freedom.  The only difference to be found is in the motives of the actors.  Hegel and Kant would suggest reason drives the action of history, while Marx would say it is economics and class conflict.  Does this shift make that much of a difference?   Is the major difference between these theories they political outlook of the theorists themselves?  Is history simply a method of interpreting the past which is easily corrupted by theoreticians to achieve political&amp;nbsp;ends?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Marx just annoys me so I want to annoy him.  I want to shout out: Annoy the liberals! Work hard and be&amp;nbsp;happy.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m glad we read Hegel before Marx, so I could see why he presented his materialistic interpretation of reality in such a defensive way.  Materialism seems so obvious to me that his attitude would have been perplexing if I&amp;#8217;d not understood what he was challenging.  Marx rejected the idea that concepts have independent reality, let alone intentionality, and began his theories with the fact that humans exist and that they have material needs in order to continue to exist (like Maslow&amp;#8217;s Hierarchy).  Because he begins with those needs, his worldview is based on production and ownership—everything is about economics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &amp;#8220;German Idealism&amp;#8221; he took several digs at Hegelians, saying that they began in heaven with ideas (154), that consciousness grows from life, not vice versa as they claim (155), and that History has no intent or self-consciousness (172).  But on page 162, he said that communism is an ideal that reality needs to conform to, which seemed more than slightly Hegelian to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had many ideas that made sense, but I never could follow his leap from This is how things are and how they should be instead to This change can only happen by revolution.  Where did revolution come from?  He made that argument several times, and every time I felt like there was a step or two missing, like the old Far Side cartoon where the scientist&amp;#8217;s formula includes &amp;#8220;here a miracle occurs&amp;#8221; to get from one step to a disconnected result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Wage Labour and Capital&amp;#8221; was my favorite section.  I&amp;#8217;d never thought of labor as a commodity—usually that word is used for grain, or to distinguish commodity chemicals from specialty chemicals—but it made a lot of sense once he pointed it out.  I do think he ignored the presence of specialized labor, though, and only focused on a certain kind of worker.  I suppose they were a bigger part of society then, and they were living through an appalling period in the development of industrialization, but even in Marx&amp;#8217;s time, they weren&amp;#8217;t the only people working for a living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciated his comment that capital is accumulated labor.  It&amp;#8217;s perfectly clear once he points it out, but I&amp;#8217;d never thought of it in those terms. He seemed bitter that workers are paid less than the value they create with their labor, but ignored the fact that they&amp;#8217;re only able to create that level of value because of the capital investments that provide them tools and materials with which to be so productive.  They were certainly oppressed, especially then, but he made it seem like they were the only generators of value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After al the dense, economic verbiage, it was astonishing to read his bit of poetry on page 216, with the uplifted arms.  That was an amazing image, with beautiful language.  God star for Marx from the writing teacher!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Capital&amp;#8221; had some good points, but they were hard to see through the glaze that kept creeping over my eyes.  I really don&amp;#8217;t like economics.  I&amp;#8217;m hoping that everyone else focused on this one, so I can see how many points I found, and what the others were that flowed past my brain on a torrent of too many words.  And saying that suggests that this is a good time to comment on Postone&amp;#8217;s chapters, which were also a torrent of too many words. As near as I could tell—both times I tried to read this (ok, I left the pdf on the screen, so that may have contributed to my struggles)—it seemed like all he did was rearrange and describe Marx&amp;#8217;s writings.  I could never find where he was extending or uncovering or adding to anything Marx had said.  I&amp;#8217;m really looking forward to the class discussion for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Crisis Theory&amp;#8221; was interesting.  Over-production is really just over-pricing, so if you lower the price, you have the right amount.  It seemed like a convoluted way of explaining supply and demand, cast in terms of the oppressed proletariat who can&amp;#8217;t afford to buy all they need.  I thought of Henry Ford, paying his workers enough that they could afford to buy the cars they were making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had a lot of interesting thoughts about how money changes barter, making it less direct and tangible, and introducing new options for disrupting the circulations of capital.  Money makes the social element of trade more abstract so we don&amp;#8217;t see it in its real terms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8220;Origin of Family…&amp;#8221; seemed the least thought out of the selections we read.  I didn&amp;#8217;t see any proof of a matrilineal origin, and he didn&amp;#8217;t explain the change to patriarchy very clearly, just saying &amp;#8220;as wealth increased&amp;#8221; (735) like that made the whole thing obvious.  Over the course of the article, he showed that patriarchy arose as part of inheritance concerns, but he never showed why inheritance concerns became an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His vision of communism transforming oppressive monogamy into free love, unshackled by concerns of inheritance, sounded like someone who&amp;#8217;s never actually been married.  I&amp;#8217;m sure there are marriages based on inheritance issues, but that whole structure seems like medieval royalty machinations, not 19th century capitalist behavior.  It was interesting to follow his thought to the idea that proletariat marriages were more likely to be about love because they&amp;#8217;re not hampered by concerns for inheritance.  Usually the proletariat are presented as helpless, hopeless brutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other prediction that seemed unrealistic and starry-eyed was around the state.  Since its only role is to protect the Haves from the Have-nots, once the laborers realize the present system isn&amp;#8217;t inevitable, they&amp;#8217;ll rise up and eliminate classes and with them the need for a state.  That just doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense in so many ways, even without thinking about how communism  really played out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All through this essay, I kept wondering if Marx had spent any time in the back of a micro bus painted with peace signs.   I know it&amp;#8217;s chronologically impossible, but the ideas, the lack of coherent connections, the free love and lack of authority—I just kept smelling patchouli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, in a sudden jerk backwards, he channeled Hegel on page 759, to leave us with a vision of &amp;#8220;the next higher plane of society to which experience, intelligence and knowledge are steadily tending.&amp;#8221;  After all the digs against German Idealism, that was a bewildering way to close this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;ve actually read Marx now.  He had some good points and interesting insights, as well a whole lot of unrealistic idealism.  My biggest question is, How does this relate to the study of history?  He was consistently economic, and frequently sociological, but only occasionally historical.  Casting history in terms of economic dialectic and class warfare seems very limiting—an interesting fad to dabble in briefly, but whose primary contribution was just to wrench historians&amp;#8217; minds back to humanity, away from abstractions.  Thank goodness we have seminar coming up to make all of this clearer!&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-3829563745520457472?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;You know, there was a time when I would have dreaded rereading Marx. That was before Hegel.&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness, I read Marx only once before, my freshman year of college in a 200 level philosophy class about the founders of Western Thought. We read Plato, Marx, Dewey, and Rousseau. And I&amp;#8217;ll admit, I wasn&amp;#8217;t enamored with Marx at the time, because I was a freshman, and all I really wanted to do was party and act like a complete idiot. It&amp;#8217;s amazing how when you look back at when you were younger, sometimes you just want to smack yourself in the face.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I got very little out of that class, because I was barely there even when I was physically in the seat. So my vision of Marx and Marxist thought was a little basic, and after reading Hegel for last week, I was genuinely excited to reread him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what I get out of Marx:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. History has a system of governments, of which the final will be socialism. Capitalism, just like feudalism or previous socioeconomic forms, will fail, and the new society will be communism in its pure, non-Soviet sense, a classless, stateless, egalitarian society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. History is the story of class struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Hegel had a great idea, just horrifically backwards; Feuerbach had a great way of using Hegel, though his conclusions were not necessarily correct. Flipping Hegel&amp;#8217;s ideas upside down was the way Marx and Engels described as being the best way to use him. The physical world is what is real, and all of our conceptions are products of it, rather than the cause of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Historical materialism is basically the concept that all society, all institutions, have an economic framework, the real foundation that everything else is built on. Economics is the key to society and history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Marx was brilliant, and his ideas, while not in vogue anymore, are an interesting way to look at the universe; but Engels is a darn better writer, and makes things much clearer than Marx does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed reading Marx much more this time; the passage of almost 5 years and a lot of growing up helps, as does having just read something infinitely more dense. The other reading, not from the primary source, was significantly less help. I did not find, this time at least, Marx to be all that difficult, or Marx&amp;#8217;s ideas to be obfuscated in any way. The Postone reading actually made Marx less comprehensible in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was good to reread Marx. I&amp;#8217;m excited for Monday&amp;#8217;s discussion.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-2713269979368058539?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;When I read Ranke, Kant and Hegel I was dumb struck on several different fronts.  In truth it was Kant and Hegel who made me struggle as Ranke I simply agreed with, for his promotion of Narrative style writing with emphasis on empirical data, i.e. primary documents won the Historiographical Debate in the&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take issue with Kant&amp;#8217;s underlining theme that history has a finite end to its evolution.  He referred to  it as the &amp;#8220;natural course&amp;#8221; which in my view is an argument for Destiny.  History in his eyes always has a &amp;#8220;logical end&amp;#8221; which is in direct conflict of my understanding of history as a &amp;#8220;Foreign Country.&amp;#8221; A conclusion that I reached with several Historiographical including my current course that when viewing history it should be a distant thing taken into account within its historical&amp;nbsp;context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humanist in me enjoys Kant&amp;#8217;s belief that states which spend all of their commonwealth on war greatly hold back the &amp;#8220;full development of human nature,&amp;#8221; which is the ultimate goal, to unlock the betters of human nature with a society as opposed to allowing the worst of human nature which according to him lie in the&amp;nbsp;individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hegel was more detailed in defining history than Kant&amp;#8217;s vague Destiny argument.  From my understanding of Hegel, there are 3 kinds of history, Original, Reflexive, and Philosophical.  Original history, in his view, is the history of Thucydides and Herodotus which take on a Political tone. Reflexive histories get divided into three sub-categories; Universal history(which concerns itself with the history of &amp;#8220;a people or a country, or of the world&amp;#8221; as a whole), Pragmatical history (&amp;#8220;reanimating the past to bear upon the present conditions of things&amp;#8221;), and Critical history(the history of history, meant to criticize historical works so as to improve them). The final form of history was the most obscure, and I sincerely did not understand it, Philosophical history which Hegel shorted as &amp;#8220;thoughtful consideration of&amp;nbsp;it[history].&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: x-small;&#34;&gt;These writings, which span roughly a century, have much to say regarding the German Idealism shared by their respective authors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: x-small;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As was typical of that movement, these writers fixated on the idea of a universal manifestation of their particular discipline. Hence their concept of &amp;#8220;universal history,&amp;#8221; defined by Ranke as &amp;#8220;encompass(ing) the events of all nations and periods, with this limitation: that they be possible subjects for scholarly debate.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philosophy and – as the movement&amp;#8217;s name suggests – idealism are to be found in all these works. The ways in which they diverge are a matter of degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most heavily philosophical – and thus least accessible – of the three works is Hegel&amp;#8217;s. Still, mixed in amid all the obtuseness, we find nuggets such as this: &amp;#8220;Nations are what their deeds are.&amp;#8221; Intriguing, too, is his expounding on the concept of freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most passionate – ergo, most idealistic – seems to be Ranke. Within his works is found the fascinating leitmotif of unattainable perfection that he nevertheless is compelled to seek. And yet fairly palpable is the joy he seems to have derived from his journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Kant&amp;#8217;s work is the most succinct on both counts. Yet he still offers much in the way of intriguing insights as regards world history. However, he looks not only at the past; in a passage more concretely prescient than anything put forth by Nostradamus, Kant offers the &amp;#8220;fantastical&amp;#8221; idea of a &amp;#8220;league of nations&amp;#8221; in which &amp;#8220;even the smallest state could expect security and justice … from a united power acting according to decisions reached under the laws of their united will.&amp;#8221; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the writings noted above do much to distill the essence of those German thinkers&amp;#8217; major contributions to the study of history. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8399157107533224051-2024005631835842119?l=bumpusjournal.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;This is a brief synopsis of three multifaceted and prodigiously expressed beliefs on Universal History by three historians: Immanuel Kant, Leopold von Ranke, and Georg Hegel. All three ascribe to the notion that human beings can advance and are in fact in a perpetual state of improvement. They see history as following a natural course, the study of which must balance the particulars with an understanding of the general trend leading on toward perfection. They each seem to combine scientific ideas with a deep spirituality, whether by asserting that Reason can be used to understand universal truths and divine plans, that evolution does point toward an ultimate goal, and/or that humanity is perfectible with careful study and an inspired capacity for change. The task of discovering these truths is a very difficult one, but one that must be attempted, and studied with great&amp;nbsp;care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their similarities, the progression of mankind is understood in slightly different ways by each of them, and their views of Universal History are shaded accordingly. Kant writes that human advancement comes from &amp;#8220;social unsociability.&amp;#8221; It is a competitive drive that lifts humans above other animals, as men both want and detest the society of their fellows. Von Ranke, the continual proponent of archival research, argues that the facts take preeminence in all historical works, with interpretation second, since generations and new documents can sometimes disprove interpretation, but strict reconstruction of how things were will withstand time. I picked the heading of my blog simply in jest, as a play on words of an all-too-frequently used phrase, but von Ranke would maintain that this is, in fact, what we do and our highest obligation. And it is from this careful attention to things as they really were that we have the best chance at correctly identifying &amp;#8220;the event itself in its human intelligibility, its unity, its diversity…we deal with humanity as it is, explicable or inexplicable; the life of the individual, of generations, or nations; and, at times, with the hand of God above them.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
Hegel evaluates that role of nature in human evolution. This idea clearly has a root in the earlier writings of Kant, who professed that human beings, like Nature, follow universal laws and evolve. However, Hegel argues that while Nature exists in cycles, the Spirit can be improved toward perfection, and in this humans derive their ability to progress and&amp;nbsp;create(54).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would argue that these men, despite some of their own claims to the contrary, are much more similar than they are different. The focal point of their conjectures(that humankind is progressing toward perfection in accordance with a divine plan and that the stages of this progression can and should be identified) is accepted by all three, but this is the point of reasoning that I would think many scholars would choose to question today. I found these studies to be very interesting, as both the obligation and limitations of academic history seemed to be laid out in terms of spirituality, which to me, seemed somewhat contradictory to these same scholar&amp;#8217;s commitment to scientific precision and detachment. Still, I enjoyed these men&amp;#8217;s contribution to a very serious question: can mankind actually&amp;nbsp;improve?  &lt;/p&gt;

(Introduction) and that man has the ability to continually progress to something better, despite his many attempts to no do so.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Of course, this teleological feel has strong elements of the Enlightenment in it.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I do find it interesting that Kant doesn&amp;#8217;t see that his historical Idea contradicts the efforts of empirical historians; as I understand his theses, it wouldn&amp;#8217;t necessarily do so, but it would alter the perception of history and the interpretation of events, such that one would end up producing the kind of history that states that, for example, the Merovingians, the Carolingians, medieval France, etc. were all purposeful steps in the creation of modern France.  &lt;p class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt; The beginning of Hegel&amp;#8217;s work is certainly much more comprehensible than the latter parts, in which he delves into the more philosophical ideas of Freedom, Spirit, and Reason—all capitalized.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Hegel divides the study of history into three broad categories: original history, reflective history, and philosophical history.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;While reading the first part of his introduction, I was rather struck by the modernity of his views that sometimes came through—certainly not everything he wrote, but part of it.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The critical reflective history, which Hegel seems to disparage, appears to be the type of history that Ranke would have favored with its &amp;#8220;criticism of historical narratives and an investigation of their truth and credibility&amp;#8221; (7).&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I found the rest of Hegel rather difficult to wade through, and I am an interested to hear everyone else&amp;#8217;s opinion on his work.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I did find Hegel&amp;#8217;s definition of history interesting, that it is the &amp;#8220;development of &amp;#8220;Spirit in Time,&amp;#8221; (72), again a statement that has a definite Enlightenment feel to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt; I found the excerpts from Ranke to be the most interesting of the three.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I&amp;#8217;m very glad that we read Grafton&amp;#8217;s history of the footnote before reading some of Ranke&amp;#8217;s specific text, as it gave me an idea of some key points to look for and, more importantly, made me aware of his place in historiography (otherwise, I would have wondered why we were reading something from this person whom I had never encountered).&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Most striking was Ranke&amp;#8217;s definite privileging of eyewitness accounts, which came through in a variety of ways, whether explicitly stated in his works or not.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;His view on this certainly seems to have filtered down to today, as James Humphreys mentioned in his blog post.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=&#34;MsoNormal&#34;&gt; As a medievalist, many of the secondary works that I read contain numerous statements that qualify the works of primary sources—something along the lines of &amp;#8220;It must be remembered that X lived and wrote 70 years after King Y died.&amp;#8221;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Or its corollary &amp;#8220;Z&amp;#8217;s writings are especially valuable, as he was a contemporary of Pope W.&amp;#8221;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Thus, I too have been trained to feel that eyewitness, or at least contemporary, accounts are of the utmost importance.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This concentration on first-hand narratives does put an interesting spotlight on last week&amp;#8217;s reading, in which we found the denigration of Spanish conquistador accounts of the New World, even though they were the first Europeans to actually &lt;i style=&#34;&#34;&gt;visit&lt;/i&gt; the American continents and have contact with the Amerindian civilizations.&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;One wonders what Ranke would have thought of their&amp;nbsp;accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Oh, German Idealism and its major proponents. I am afraid of Kant and Hegel, of German Idealism in general. Until doing these readings, I had very little knowledge of who they were or what they stood for, or even how they fit into historical thought, but I knew that Hegel was nigh-incomprehensible, and Kant was the founding father, and that was enough.&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#8217;s sad that you&amp;#8217;re taught to fear Hegel before even reading him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we&amp;#8217;ve actually read some of Kant&amp;#8217;s work, I have a much better sense of why he is important, even if I have some questions. He clearly believes, in these theses, in some sort of destiny, racial if not individual— Kant&amp;#8217;s second thesis, the idea that humanity as a whole is going in one, unstoppable, progressively more rational direction regardless of individual actions seems a bit… well, optimistic, really. The idea that humanity in any way can head towards rationality seems, in the modern world, to still be a pipe dream. Technology may improve, but people in general are still as stupid, paranoid, prone to violence, and superstitious as ever. The fact that he doesn&amp;#8217;t think individuals head towards rationality proves its idealism, not lunacy, to support his theories, but I think individuals do have the power to change the course of human history in their own way. I wonder what he would think of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kant&amp;#8217;s fourth thesis, though, made me feel a lot better, and relax while reading this. &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, there is the ideal vision that humanity as a whole is improving, but humanity improve via antagonism—the old argument of progress through war in philosophical form. The idea of creating a perfect civic state, which he argues for, doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to work with this idea, but he admits it to be the greatest problem and goal in human history. This, he believes, is the driving force in human history—the irrevocable progress towards a single civic society where all men live under the rule of law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general idea of German Idealism, that the way we perceive the world around us reflects us, rather than the universe, makes a lot of sense to me. Maybe I&amp;#8217;ve watched the Matrix too many times, but reality is basically what we perceive, regardless of whatever may be lurking behind. If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around, does it make a sound? The real question, in my opinion, is does anyone care? And no, for the record—we don&amp;#8217;t perceive it, it didn&amp;#8217;t happen. I&amp;#8217;ve got Kant et al.&amp;#8217;s back on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hegel&amp;#8217;s piece opened with his discussion of the three kinds of history: Original, Reflective, and Philosophical. I&amp;#8217;m a sucker for Original History. Herodotus, Thucydides, most of the good stuff—deeds and events and states of society? Narrative of the universe around them and their experiences? My favorite kind of sources. I love primary documents, or secondary documents close enough to the source to still be mostly eyewitness. Reflective history is history that transcends a specific time period—a universal history, like Livy, or a pragmatic history, dealing with the present, or a critical history, historiography. Not the best, nor my favorite, though certainly useful in all three forms. And philosophical history… well… a thoughtful consideration of history, as Hegel says, is a good thing, but after last week&amp;#8217;s book, I don&amp;#8217;t really like this philosophical history, or the philosophical traveler, or any of that nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not nonsense. That&amp;#8217;s unfair. The book &lt;em&gt;How to Write the History of the New World&lt;/em&gt; was just so convincing that I find myself prejudiced against 18th century Enlightenment historians and their theories, and against the concept of philosophical history and travelers. I don&amp;#8217;t believe that there are universal laws that can be applied to all of history, or even to the entire nature of the universe. Chance, chaos, whatever you call it, have a very real part in events—history is not predetermined, history is a mutable object. Maybe it is my lack in the belief of predestination that makes me argue against any kind of knowable history, but I don&amp;#8217;t not believe in the inevitability of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This relates back to his arguments about Reason in History, in that sometimes things happen by chance, or by accident. Causality can be established, but there does not have to be logic behind it. There is no &amp;#8220;ultimate destiny&amp;#8221; of the world except for entropy, and the inevitable end of all life makes for either a very poor or a stunningly brilliant guiding factor behind human history. I&amp;#8217;m not sure which it is yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Hegel&amp;#8217;s piece is really interesting, if so dense as to be actually painful to read. The discussion of Sprit, and how it relates to culture and a nation, was hard for me to understand—I wanted Sparknotes to explain to me what the heck he was talking about. I still don&amp;#8217;t claim to understand it, but the link to religion, and his attempts to reconcile human history with the divine… well, that did make a lot of sense. Evil and God. History is filled with examples of evil, in all forms, from the great to the small, and reconciling the existence of it with an all-mighty, all-good God is one I am not able to even attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that history is an expression of freedom struck me as another example of the slightly naïve nature of Hegel and Kant. The spirit expresses its freedom through history? History seems more an expression of repression to me. Man, I&amp;#8217;m feeling like a major pessimist, but really. Slavery, oppression, autocracy, this is the unifying message of human history. Theoretically free societies pop up like a brief dream, and are crushed under the weight of reality. Athens lasted what, 500 years?, before it was brought back under a monarchy. And it was the longest lasting democracy so far. I like to hope we&amp;#8217;ll break the trend, but man. Freedom as the unifying factor in history. Wow. And yes, I know he then says that Freedom as an Idea is natural, and doesn&amp;#8217;t exist in practice, but I don&amp;#8217;t think even in nature, outside of the human condition, there is a natural freedom waiting to burst through. Queen bees, alpha males, pack leaders, etc., nature has a hierarchy, and there is a low, dominated end of the totem pole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hegel is pretty much what I thought he&amp;#8217;d be. Really important, but I&amp;#8217;ll read secondary sources about him next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranke, after Kant and Hegel, was a breath of fresh air. I already know a little bit about him from Grafton&amp;#8217;s book, and while he&amp;#8217;s a 19th century German author, his ideas about modern source methodology are important, and his writing style was quite a bit easier to grasp. I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;m going to talk much about Ranke, maybe in class, but it&amp;#8217;d be interesting to read more of his works.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-3595616783294855512?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Either my parents read Ranke to me as a child&amp;nbsp;or my teachers in grade school preached him, but I&amp;#8217;ve always felt that the proper way to present history was through the facts and how things really were.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;In reading Ranke&amp;#8217;s many introductions and snippets, one can learn of his method wherein he felt that history was a science requiring inordinate amounts of source knowledge.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;When I read the part about the &amp;#8220;reader is animated by feelings of pleasure and hope, on examining the catalogues,&amp;#8221; (61) I thought to myself that he was like a kid in a candy store walking into the archives of the cities.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I also deduced that he was either rich himself,&amp;nbsp;had rich benefactors, or a great expense account to be able to travel to these places and live there while researching in the archives.&lt;br /&gt;Ranke makes several important observations and statements; like saying don&amp;#8217;t pity people who like to read old papers because these are the remnants of past ages(70), or that knowledge is inconceivable without knowing the events of past ages(113), or that historical works of great reputation and usefulness become obsolete. (258)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Even though he wanted his work to be his legacy, he apparently knew that eventually it would be eclipsed by better work.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Doesn&amp;#8217;t that sound a bit like Kant, whom he disliked?&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4129143196680670213-1602076510016091922?l=historical-james.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Immanuel Kant proposes that history is not simply the recorded events of men as they struggle against each other and against nature for survival.  Rather, human history has a meaning, a divine purpose, as it outlines the development of mankind along a path ordained by God.  Kant suggests that God—Nature—has fore-ordained man to develop a harmonious global civilization wherein the individual is freed of barbarousness and vanity.  In Kant&amp;#8217;s universal future history, rationality and morality have triumphed over self-interested&amp;nbsp;individualism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This development is structured along man&amp;#8217;s dual nature of building and destroying.  Man craves cohabitation and community so he develops societies wherein he may live with others, yet his innate individualism causes him to break with society the instant it is established.  According to Kant, this contradiction is divine, and it is the driving mechanism behind history—history is driven by mankind&amp;#8217;s inner conflict.  Only over time does man learn to be rational and moral, and only then to societies thrive and become civilized.  Once established, nations develop similarly, devolving into warfare and strife until they can learn to peacefully coexist under a larger, international governing body.  The end of history will be found in the globalization of freedom and liberty, for only then can man truly understand God and assume his true (and possibly existential)&amp;nbsp;consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what does this say about history as a profession.  For the purposes of the modern historian, Kant suggests that history is merely the story of human conflict and the development of a rational morality rooted in the results of conflict.  To be sure, there is a larger meta-history of divine guidance and progress, but Kant simply cannot separate philosophy from history.  As such, his system is innately flawed as he looks for only what he seeks to find.  To a certain extent, all historians to this; but Kant&amp;#8217;s philosophically driven history is very narrow in its perspective and may marginalize or obscure the actual causes and meanings of&amp;nbsp;events. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading Kant&amp;#8217;s theory of a universal cosmopolitan history, I am curious where we may place a history written according to such parameters within the three constructs of history established by Hegel?  To be sure, Kant&amp;#8217;s construct does not fall into the category of original history.  Within Kant&amp;#8217;s construct one could arguably find elements of universal and pragmatic reflective history, but there may also be trends towards the larger philosophical history.  Where does Kant&amp;#8217;s interpretation of history fit within Hegel&amp;#8217;s constructs—into which category does Kant fall?  Do Kant&amp;#8217;s and Hegel&amp;#8217;s individual theories mesh with each other on a larger&amp;nbsp;scale?&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Ok, the first thing I have got to say is, Thank goodness these papers were easier to follow than the book from last week.  I understood what they had to say, and could discern an outline or structure to their thoughts.  Very refreshing and reassuring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hegel began by looking briefly at various kinds or styles of writing history—original, universal, pragmatic, critical, and transitions—before introducing philosophical, where he then focused his attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation for his philosophical history is basically neo-Platonic.  Universal Reason is both the guide and the substance of the Universe.  This Universal Reason is progressing toward an Ultimate Goal by way of successive waves of human events and eras.  Seen this way, from a perspective of Universal Progress, particular events that would seem tragic can be interpreted as brief and necessary steps toward an Ultimate Good.  Humans contribute to this progress inadvertently as they pursue what they think are their individual goals.  Reason uses these human acts to accomplish the Ultimate Goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On page 36, his said that Philosophy is the process of figuring out what this Ultimate Goal is, so we can correctly interpret the events of history and thereby see—prove—that &amp;#8220;the real world is as it ought to be&amp;#8221; (36).  Seeing this Real perspective makes the ordinary, &amp;#8220;incoherent&amp;#8221; events fall into a Reason-guided cycle of progress, or Universal History.  And then he said that the State—law, morality, government—is the only arena in which this progress is made; it is &amp;#8220;the Divine Idea as it exists on Earth&amp;#8221; (39).  Because the State provides structure and constrains impulses, only it provides the setting for this Universal Progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On page 52, he mentioned that people are as limited by their time as by their location, but he didn&amp;#8217;t indicate that this applied to him.  I refuse to give into the temptation to feel superior here, because he&amp;#8217;s right.  And it applies to us just as much as to him, except we theoretically understand it, without being able to identify our limitations any more than he could his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By page 54, he&amp;#8217;s ready to use all these ideas to look at the Course of the World&amp;#8217;s History, though still at a theoretical and anonymous level.  He said that though growth and development in Nature proceed uneventfully, in the Spiritual realm they&amp;#8217;re filled with conflict because there&amp;#8217;s both the lure of the currently obvious goal and the inevitability of the Ultimate Goal.  Sometimes the current goal seems thwarted, but that&amp;#8217;s an error of perspective—everything that happens leads closer to that Ultimate Goal.  Upheavals throughout history have been the transitions between a settled and achieved Spirit of One Age to the onset of the Spirit of the Next Age.  The upheaval is good, because States need a new goal to work toward in order to avoid becoming listless and flaccid, or being overrun by the private goals of individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout this section, I watched him peel away huge areas of history that must be disregarded for one reason or another—India focusing on distinctions instead of unity, China focusing on individual happiness instead of State good.  But even this didn&amp;#8217;t quite prepare me for the outrageous prejudice in the Geographic section.  In order to qualify as part of his Universal History, you need the proper climate, suitable natural resources, the correct religion, sufficient group identity, an interactive geographic position, and so on.  Basically, you need to be Protestant Europe.  His thesis works great as long as you ignore everything that doesn&amp;#8217;t fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hegel&amp;#8217;s thesis is indeed Idealistic, and more than slightly self-congratulatory, but it does sort of hang together as long as you wrap your mind around his very provincial worldview.  I can see how people would have loved to see Progress in terms that excused or explained horrible events.  But it seems an awful lot like children&amp;#8217;s Christianity, rephrased with philosophical vocabulary:   Don&amp;#8217;t worry, God has it under control, everything happens for a reason, it&amp;#8217;s His will, and so on.  I don&amp;#8217;t see, though, how it was supposed to help historians to organize and understand large bunches of apparently disparate data, other than by ignoring most of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kant is obviously on the same page, but in a delightfully brief version.  He also focused on large groups over individuals, assumed a goal that creation is moving toward, put human actions in service to this Universal Goal, and said that the State—or society—is the only arena for progress because social restraints provide freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He does focus on individuals more than Hegel did, though, especially in thesis four.  There, he said that humans are drawn into social groups, but within those groups we still seek our individual will, so conflict is inevitable.  On a smaller scale than Hegel, he reiterates that conflict and striving are better for progress than is ease and concord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His other point of difference is that he identifies this Ultimate Goal as a single coordinated league of all Nations.  When everyone is constrained by the same set of expectations, all our competitive nature will go toward human development, instead of toward competition and destruction.  All of the wars and chaos now are necessary to guide us toward this universal State that will be the Goal of history&amp;#8217;s efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, Kant is very idealistic.  He specifically pointed out at the end that philosophers offer this perspective to augment the empiricism of historians, not to replace it, which I found to be more realistic than saying it&amp;#8217;s a good way to actually write history.  There are a lot of people who do see life this way, though they use different terms to discuss it.  Understanding that this worldview may be involved makes it easier to infer motivations for behaviors we run across in research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read von Ranke first, so I saw him distancing himself before I knew what he was distancing himself from.  Now when I look at his insistence on facts and proof and accuracy, I see why he was so adamant.  He focuses on archives because he wants to know what happened, not how events can be interpreted into a shape that fits this theory of Universal Progress. And he believes people drive history in a much more intentional way than Hegel and Kant describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He stressed over and over that different times and places must be evaluated for themselves, based on their own events and character.  Eventually, on page 250, he summed up the value of considering a universal scope of history, but he still insisted that we use particular events, and let them dictate the shape of this meta-story, not the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being clearly oriented differently from the others, he does use phrases like &amp;#8220;peoples have developed in unison and along similar lines&amp;#8221; (57), &amp;#8220;the development of the unity and the progress of the events&amp;#8221; (58), &amp;#8220;private collections…[are]…not to be compared with the riches of the state archives&amp;#8221; (62-63), &amp;#8220;a portion of the history of the world, and of the general progress of mankind&amp;#8221; (66), &amp;#8220;truth can be but one&amp;#8221; (72) and so on.  I see how people could think he was part of the Idealists.  But in the section from page 101 on, he insists on particulars and eyewitnesses, and says that pieces of history fit into a Universal History on their own terms, not within the constraints of a preconceived theory of Progress.  He did have a new and important contribution to make, and I&amp;#8217;m glad he insisted on being heard.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-4516265652637414399?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Hegel&amp;#8217;s types of history – original, reflective, philosophical – make sense when one looks at the emerging discipline of history in the European intellectual world.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It actually does what the people and governments wanted from history of the time; to know where they came from, to relate it to their time, and then to ponder the why of things, and where civilization was going.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;In the first part Hegel does well explaining the basis for history with Herodotus and Thucydides, and what defines original history.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Breaking down reflective into universal, pragmatical, critical, and fragmentary allows for easier classification of many manuscripts during his day.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;I especially liked that he noted the debate about how history ought to be written was frustrating; it appears this question has been around a while. (4)&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;And he makes a note that writers were not distinguishing their time from the time about which they wrote. (5) His whole Spirit/Reason/Providence section was confusing and daunting. I look forward to hearing comments on that both here and in class.&lt;br /&gt;When I got to the &amp;#8216;Geographical Basis of History&amp;#8217; part it was plain that Hegel was a man of his times, and very Eurocentric.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;It was like he was channeling Buffon claiming the Americas were totally inferior, and as such their history was of no import.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Then, continent by continent he checks them off as having no bearing on &amp;#8220;true&amp;#8221; world history, which can only come from the Mediterranean area; and Germany of course with Julius Caesar&amp;#8217;s crossing of the Alps.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;For all his comments&amp;nbsp;about blacks and slavery being a &amp;#8220;natural condition,&amp;#8221; I like that he comes back to say, &amp;#8220;Slavery is in and for itself &lt;i style=&#34;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&#34;&gt;injustice&lt;/i&gt;, for the essence of humanity if &lt;i style=&#34;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&#34;&gt;Freedom&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; (99) &lt;/span&gt;This is just a few observations of mine.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The quick outline I did for this took a page and a half.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;What struck the rest of you as odd?&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Was anything eye-opening? I found a lot of his work still relevant for today, just not the we&amp;#8217;re better than everyone else part.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4129143196680670213-6990468981208078851?l=historical-james.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Here is my take&amp;nbsp;on Kant&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View.&amp;#8221; (1784).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style: normal; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Immanuel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Kant was a deep thinker, but still a man of his time.&amp;nbsp; This reading was from the period just before the French Revolution, and after the American War of Independence.&amp;nbsp; So, yes it would seem as if the world was in chaos, with different groups opposing each other looking to assert their collective will.&amp;nbsp; His introduction seems to be an attempt at soothing anxious Europeans in saying that the destructiveness will work out in the end for the betterment of man.&amp;nbsp; His first thesis seems to sum up the idea of the Enlightenment – in which humans are progressing to a natural end through their own ability to reason; with the understanding that this &amp;#8216;natural&amp;#8217; end is far better than the current state of human affairs.&amp;nbsp; His second thesis would appear to answer why there are peasants and nobility, ignorant, slow, normal, smart, and gifted individuals by saying that the human race itself advances, but not all individuals move at the same pace. (Good statement of the obvious) Thesis three appears to set the stage for man taking credit for the bettering of life through his own abilities, as if to say it was done without divine intervention.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Thesis four comes off to me as a justification for taking Amerindian lands.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Thesis five, six, and even seven are the framework to create this &amp;#8216;just constitution&amp;#8217; Kant wants.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Thesis eight and nine are the justification for the need of universal constitution between countries.&lt;br /&gt;In all this Kant appears to head toward a humanist idea of the world.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;A world in which we humans make it on our own, and without any help from above.&lt;span style=&#34;mso-spacerun: yes;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;However, he circles back toward &amp;#8216;Providence&amp;#8217; at least to link the deist idea to the Enlightenment where God, or Providence, watches with approval what the reasoning men have created.&lt;br /&gt;What else can be learned from this excerpt from Kant&amp;#8217;s work?&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4129143196680670213-2480785272401964684?l=historical-james.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <id>/history510/blog/raction-to-canizares-esguerrae28099s-how-to-write-the-history-of-the-new-world.html</id>
            
            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;For starters, I will be entirely honest and admit that there were portions of this book that were, to say the least, a struggle.  That does not mean, however, that I think that Canizares-Esguerra is a bad writer. In fact, he is a very good writer: clear, concise, direct.  I think that it is the nature of the source material and the subject that make it so dry at&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, there are some very good parts to this book.  The story of Boturini.  shows the various origins of modern historiography: ideological battles, patriotism, egos, and&amp;#8211; what else?&amp;#8211;sources.  It seems interesting that people could recognize that there was a new movement going on in history&amp;#8230; and yet still want an older, more moralizing purpose behind it. It seems laughable to us that people would take the writing of a history this personally, but also allows us to see that history &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HAD&lt;/span&gt; a purpose and was a tool which they could use to their advantage. But what is more important and impressive to me are the countless people who, what ever their motive, began to question the use of sources (especially, in this case, native) and the scholarship that was done on sources which was in a real way very&amp;nbsp;new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particularly interesting facet of Canizares-Esguerra&amp;#8217;s writing I particularly appreciate is the human element that manages to show through. The motives he ascribes to not only those trying to sort out this history (and, often implicitly, those of their detractors) are interesting in that the are, as we experience today, a combination of personal, professional, and often political.  Where he is most effective, though, is in his word choices. When attempting to define &amp;#8220;nations&amp;#8221;  he defines them not as &amp;#8220;fraternities of citizens&amp;#8221; but &amp;#8220;fraternities of &lt;em&gt;Virtuous&lt;/em&gt; citizens&amp;#8221; (emphasis mine; pg. 204). The reason for this word choice, I think, it to show not only what the definition of a nation is (which many in his intended audience would be familiar with anyway) but how a patriotic observer might want their people shown. That he does this in one word where other might have taken more is a credit to the subtlety in his&amp;nbsp;writing.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;At the end of his introduction and thorough outline of his book, Jorge Canizares-Esguerra  managed to get my attention blatantly declaring war on what he calls North Atlantic-centric historiography.  He calls the understanding  of the what the West is as &amp;#8220;amusingly Pompous.&amp;#8221;    He openly challenges what is expected of him as a specialist of Latin American history by saying &amp;#8220;I have learned that the public expects from historians of the region cautionary tales of revolutionary violence and, if socially conscious, stories of cunning peasants resisting treacherous oligarchs.  I am a storyteller of a different kind, who believes that there ought to be other tales for the public to consume.&amp;#8221;  With this kind of fire in his writing I hoped for the rest of the book to channel rage constructed in such a way as to amuse me and keep me begging for more.  I was mistaken.  This book was a sincerely difficult read, but that is not to say I did not learn from&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like his concept of the philosophical traveler, a scholar who is &amp;#8220;aware of the inadequacies of human perception and hence doubted the bare testimony of the senses,&amp;#8221; and their &amp;#8220;philosophical histories of the land and peoples of the America in which evidence from linguistics, natural history, ethnology, and geology took&amp;nbsp;precedence.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found very interesting the struggle that Spanish historians had in the 18th century attempting to patriotically defend their nation from historiographical attacks coming from Northern Europe.  If the Spanish historians stuck to what was &amp;#8220;cutting edge&amp;#8221; or I should really say &amp;#8220;fashionable&amp;#8221; readings of sources and writing of history then Spain would look like the &amp;#8220;Bad guy&amp;#8221; in history or the Ignorant in their 18th century&amp;nbsp;present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I enjoyed his attack on misconceptions and the anti-Spanish bias that seemed to plague a good deal of historiographical literature, while at the same time balancing the reading of Spanish sources with a critical&amp;nbsp;eye.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Somebody (maybe or maybe not Winston Churchill) once said, &amp;#8220;History is written by the victors.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some four centuries following Columbus&amp;#8217; 1492 voyage, Spain unquestionably was among the biggest winners in the realm of New World colonization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet, as Jorge Canizares-Esguerra&amp;#8217;s book seems to illustrate, even among Spaniards, there was in those years no clear consensus regarding the histories of the conquered regions, or the conduct of their &amp;#8220;countrymen&amp;#8221; as they did their conquering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say &amp;#8220;seems&amp;#8221; for two reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this is a very dense work. Canizares-Esguerra not only elaborates at length on his main points, he also has a habit of repeating them, making his writing that much thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this book also has challenged me in a second, and more significant, way. It underscores the ways we often cast our own inherent biases as the &amp;#8220;gold standard&amp;#8221; by which other outlooks are to be judged. Unquestioningly attuned to our accepted views of history, we have a knee-jerk tendency to dismiss alternative views, even when, objectively viewed, they are no more and/or no less &amp;#8220;fantastic&amp;#8221; than our own. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I read Canizares-Esguerra&amp;#8217;s words, I became conscious of the fact that my initial reactions thereto were to some extent shaped and colored by that which I&amp;#8217;ve long thought I know to be true. Conversely, I get the sense that those words are in some ways a manifestation of what the author thinks or wishes to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does that make sense? No? Well, I&amp;#8217;m not sure it does to me, either. This is heady stuff.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8399157107533224051-5077074550650313988?l=bumpusjournal.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Canizares-Esguerra, Jorge.  &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;How to Write the History of the New World&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his heavily researched book, Canizares-Esguerra (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt;) explores the ways in which Spanish and New World historiography of the New World changed in response to politics, the development of history, and the growing idea of nationalism.  Throughout the course of the book, he discusses the debate concerning alphabetical vs. non-alphabetical texts and their mertis, the effects of patriotism on Spanish historiography in response to criticism from the rest of Europe about Spain and Spanish historians, effective elitism as historians chose to downplay common accounts of the conquest and the New World in favor of Amerindian aristocrats, and the distrust of foreign and &amp;#8220;armchair philosopher&amp;#8221; accounts of the New World.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although my head was certainly spinning from the names of so many different 17th- and 18th-century historians, and I sometimes got irritated at &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt; for going on rather long tangents to explain one point, the book overall gave me some new perspectives on how we write history: the privileging of certain types of sources, the effects of politics on history, and the ways in which we decide the validity of accounts.  Certainly, the practice of researching and writing history has changed since the time period covered in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s, but these considerations are still valid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In particular, I found the preference for aristocratic Amerindian sources interesting.  As a medievalist, the sources I have encountered, and am likely to see in the future, are the products of the elite; they&amp;#8217;re all we have, no matter how much we might like to know about every non-aristocrat in Europe.  Thus, although I understand the rationale of the time (members of the elite writing histories are perhaps rather likely to prefer accounts from other members of the ruling classes), I find it interesting, and disheartening from an informational standpoint, that the views, histories, and myths of so many common Amerindians were ignored because they were viewed as being untrustworthy&amp;#8212;especially in a time/place when so many other sources, such as the non-alphabetical ones, were also viewed as inaccurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint with the book is that &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt; seems to have forgotten about Peru and the Inca civilization partway through.  I&amp;#8217;m not very familiar with the history of the Spanish colonies, or certainly of the historiography associated with them, so it&amp;#8217;s possible that the histories of the Inca entered a standstill/lack-of-debate period.  If so, however, I rather wish that &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt; had directly addressed that, rather than choosing to spend the remainder of the book exclusively in Central America.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6220711600267285330-7950931598184295473?l=jawhite21.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I found Jorge Canizares-Esguerra&amp;#8217;s book to be an interesting tale of the debates that have taken place over Spanish American historiography. Historians today often operate under a shared set of assumptions of what constitutes proper historical evidence and how it should be used. This is not to say that every historian approaches their craft in the same manner; rather, there is an accepted methodology among&amp;nbsp; historians that has only recently emerged into academia. Recently in this context refers to the 1800s, when professional history first made its mark as a legitimate field of scholarly study. As Esguerra&amp;#8217;s book reveals, however, prior to this development there existed no general consensus as to the &amp;#8220;best&amp;#8221; method of historical study, particularly in reference to what sources should be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary focus of Esguerra&amp;#8217;s book falls on the discourses that arose surrounding the evidentiary aspect of writing a history of the Spanish American colonies from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. I was impressed at the amount of information Esguerra was able to incorporate into his book without losing his central focus. I found his decision to concentrate on the mutual influence of Europe and the New World to be particularly interesting. As one would expect, European developments inevitably impacted how scholars approached native sources to write a history of the colonies. More surprising, however, are the ways in which colonial intellectual trends exerted their own influence. Especially towards the late eighteenth century Spanish American scholars began to promote a more aggressively patriotic history of the New World that did not depend on European intellectual thought, and in fact directly countered European assumptions on the value of native sources. Much of the debate that raged over native sources centered around this very issue of reliability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Esguerra, the most important differences between indigenous source types was alphabetical or non-alphabetical. He does an excellent job of drawing out the positions held by those who advocated a general acceptance of non literary sources as opposed to those who believed that only written works could provide a reliable foundation for writing the New World&amp;#8217;s history. The polemic between these two sides took a quite convoluted path as trends in historical thought shifted over the centuries. Esguerra relates not only who adhered to which opinion, but he also explains the rational behind each position and examines how individual contributions affected later discourse on the reliability of indigenous sources. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most useful contributions of Esguerra&amp;#8217;s book is its synthetic nature. As one can tell from the bibliography, there is certainly no dearth of material on the subject. There was, however, a lack of coherence and consolidation. Esguerra&amp;#8217;s book does an excellent job of bringing together an intimidating amount of scattered research into a single manageable volume. His study does not end with a universal authoritarian conclusion purporting to have finally clarified the history of New World historiography. Instead, he is satisfied with the sporadically progressive nature of the New World&amp;#8217;s history that emerged throughout his three hundred and fifty pages of research. I appreciated Esguerra&amp;#8217;s decision to refrain from attempting to impose a more uniform and linear history than that which his research revealed. It made the book far more interesting and, in my opinion at least, lent his conclusions an added sense of credibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the book was an interesting read that illuminated a great deal on New World historiography as well as general intellectual trends in Europe from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. His work made me question source usage in history today, something I had not given much consideration to prior to reading this book. It certainly draws attention to the question of why historians choose to use the sources that they do and what underlying cultural values are determining which sources are ascribed value. The very nature of historical writing is dependent upon what evidence is used to construct a scholarly work, and I appreciate Esguerra&amp;#8217;s book providing at least a little information on of the most important aspects of history.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-6838543346825558104?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;How to Write the History of the&amp;nbsp;New World&lt;/u&gt;, by Jorge Canizares-Esguerra is a history of the European historiographic tradition of depicting the New World.&amp;nbsp; In particular, Canizares-Esguerra deals with sixteenth through nineteenth century eurocentricism and how it affected historical works about the Aztecs, Incas, Mexica and others.&amp;nbsp; I found this to be a very interesting book because it does an excellent job of illustrating the dangers&amp;nbsp;involved with dealing with subjects that are far removed from&amp;nbsp;the historian by both time and geography.&amp;nbsp; The author reflects on the major conjectural faux pas of notable historians of the aforementioned centuries and their&amp;nbsp;sometimes comical&amp;nbsp;depictions of the peoples of the Americas.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evidently, at least where the Americas were concerned, the&amp;nbsp;academic hubris abounded&amp;nbsp;through&amp;nbsp;different historiographical eras and schools of thought from Renaissance humanism&amp;nbsp;and the Enlightenment to romanticism.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is evident in many historians&amp;#8217; refusal to believe eyewitness accounts of Spaniards because they were thought, as a people, to be deceitful by nature.&amp;nbsp; Also, historians&amp;#8217; depictions of the New World always seemed to have an alternate agenda serving some political purpose or to prove an alternate point, such as Locke&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&lt;/em&gt; (1690).&amp;nbsp; Possibly the most intriguing thing about this book is that it makes me wonder if we ever got historiography&amp;nbsp;right?&amp;nbsp; I mean, how do you write objectively when it&amp;#8217;s impossible to be objective?&amp;nbsp; We say that good historians simply have to work around that dilemma, but the men in this book also thought they were employing the best means of getting at the truth, often missing the mark completely.&amp;nbsp; I don&amp;#8217;t know about us, but as for them, I think Canizares-Esguerra sums it up nicely on page 103 when he stated that &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;two impediments had to be overcome to create the science of history, namely, &lt;em&gt;la boria delle nazioni&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; and &lt;em&gt;la boria de&amp;#8217; dotti&lt;/em&gt;: the conceit of nations and the conceit of the learned.&amp;#8221;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8880139849602883287-7443122240228856458?l=dixonro.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Jorge Canizares-Esguerra, &lt;em&gt;How to Write the History of the New&amp;nbsp;World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his voluminously footnoted tome, Canizares-Esguerra sets out demonstrate that a critical, scientific, source-based practice of history developed in Spain and her American colonies prior to the emergence of Leopold von Ranke as the father of modern&amp;nbsp;history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very briefly, the author&amp;#8217;s argument suggests that in Renaissance and Enlightenment Europe a &amp;#8220;conjectural&amp;#8221; or philosophical methodology developed which later morphed, via epistemological debates, into a system which placed validity on contextually understood primary sources and the inclusion of extra-literary sources.  Rather than discount Amerindian sources, early Spanish chroniclers went to great length to include them in their works and the suspicion of Amerindian sources was the result of an Enlightenment era backlash against Renaissance humanism.  The Spanish literati were actively engaged in a debate about the validity and use of sources pertaining to the New World, thus creating a prototype of Ranke&amp;#8217;s modern methodology of history.  Ultimately, this method found its way to the New World and was used by patriotic bourgeois writers to critique European histories of the region as&amp;nbsp;uninformed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing the book, one wonders about the author&amp;#8217;s intent because the narrative ends rather abruptly without a satisfactory conclusion.  If Canizares-Esguerra intended to demonstrate, through his narrative, that colonial Spain developed a critical, scientific method of historical investigation then he succeeded—documentary evidence may suggest a protomorphic theory of critical history in colonial Spain.  If this was his goal, however, he could simply have written a lengthy article or two and accomplished just as much as he did with his book.  The book simply does not leave the reader with a sense of accomplishment or&amp;nbsp;closure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the book, I found myself wondering: if this was a concerted trans-Atlantic movement among the literati of imperial Spain, why did it fail to have any impact on the larger Western world?  The author suggests, in chapter 3, that this protomorphic scientific history gained great prominence in Spain, but that factionalism at court and within the academy over methodology ultimately derailed most attempts to publish prominent histories and relegated many manuscripts dusty archives.  Annoyingly, he only briefly addresses actual circumstances which likely prohibited the success of this movement in his discussion of Spanish&amp;nbsp;unity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this leaves me wondering—if the movement was hampered by factionalism both within the academy and at court, and if it failed to produce any major literary works acknowledged by the larger Western world, was the movement really a coherent movement at all?  Furthermore, does it even matter if these developments were occurring in Spain if they failed to influence scholars in the rest of Europe?  Often times it is not the discoverer who gets credit but the man who popularizes the idea.  Lastly, one has to wonder, was the movement fully understood in the New World, or was its methodology simply co-opted in service to patriotic goals in the wake of imperial Spain&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;collapse?&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;I will freely admit that I picked this book at my first presentation on a lark&amp;#8212;I&amp;#8217;m not a huge fan of Marxist critique, and I don&amp;#8217;t yet feel comfortable with material culture or feminist theory, so I thought, &amp;#8220;Hey, a book on the historiography of the New World! That sounds different.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s always nice when your gambles pay off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jorge Canizares-Esguera&amp;#8217;s text is a fantastic analysis of the historiographic debates that emerged during the eighteenth century in Spain and Spanish America, essentially on the reliability of Amerindian sources. This is an incredible simplification of the debate, which also involved northern European views on Spanish backwardness, the effects of patriotism, and the like, but I have the opportunity to discuss them at length tomorrow night when I lead the discussion, so I just want to touch on a couple of points I found most interesting/useful. The cyclical nature of the historiographic debate interested me greatly, and I find it applicable in my own research. Renaissance humanist historians took native accounts to be of the highest value; Enlightenment philosophical historians denigrated them; the reaction sought to give them mixed status; and in the end we now view them as worthwhile again. Of course, this isn&amp;#8217;t to say there aren&amp;#8217;t flaws with the sources, or that we don&amp;#8217;t have to be careful in how we use them, but in the end the use of these sources is once again admired and encouraged. The way history is thought about, the &amp;#8220;philosophy of history,&amp;#8221; changes, and what we think of as the correct method right now may not be viewed that way in, say, a century. Anything we write as historians may someday be slammed for using antiquated ideas, or be taught in a class simply to show how ignorant scholars used to be. It&amp;#8217;s a humbling thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that the arguments used by both sides, the patriotic aspects of the text, were incredibly informative. I&amp;#8217;ve thought about nationalist histories, and I&amp;#8217;ve also considered how patriotism affects the way history is taught in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; schools, but I had not thought about the grander implications when it came to the study of history in general. The idea of the Spanish American Enlightenment, the differences between the Spanish and northern European Enlightenments, the idea that Spain was backwards, antiquated and medieval&amp;#8230; even the general idea of a Protestant vision of history versus a Catholic one, all of these are areas I had not ever pondered. The book does a great job of showing the grander scale of the problem, while focusing on the very specific internal debates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thought on the book: this book, &lt;em&gt;How to Write the History of the New World&lt;/em&gt;, looks at such a specific time, place and problem&amp;#8212;how eighteenth century Spanish historians dealt with the history of the New World. At the same time, it uses this narrow lens to explore how we, as modern historians, think about Atlantic history, how the greater debates of Enlightenment vs. Renaissance history were shaped, how our views on native sources, reliability of primary source, etc., were developed, and how Spanish and Latin American history has been pushed out of the realm of the &amp;#8220;Western&amp;#8221; world and into the fringes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only I could do something so incredibly complex through a microstudy.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-8129935086765661736?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

Post 2: How to Write the History of the New&amp;nbsp;World&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra clearly illustrates how complex and often bitter debates over credibility shaped the historical writings of the New World. Seemingly each effort at historiography was highly contested and very personal, as questions of intellectual capability and scholarly merit were not only leveled against individuals, but whole societies. Some believed that indigenous people and sources were not to be trusted. Multiple scholars proposed pseudo-scientific studies that the climate of the region disallowed Amerindian credibility since they were inherently inferior people, prone to lying. Others believed that their society was far less-developed, so reports of former grandeur and their own reports could not be trusted. This argument was furthered in many attacks on Amerindians&amp;#8217; system of record-keeping, which did not use alphabetic writing. As Cañizares-Esguerra explains on page 64, &amp;#8220;Since God had transmitted his dispensation through the written word, societies that lacked &amp;#8220;writing&amp;#8221; were considered not only outside the pale of civilization, but humanity as well…Amerindian nonalphabetic scripts were, therefore, considered incapable of accumulating knowledge, which was the foundation of civilization.&amp;#8221; Many reacted against such negative characterizations of the Amerindian societies, though for varying reasons. Clearly this was an affront to the learning and humanity of the societies in the New World and some scholars, particularly from the New World, took offense and strove  to disprove such notions in their&amp;nbsp;publications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Others sought to defend Spanish conquistadors and colonials, since these dismissals of early Spanish observations also discredited the Spanish accounts as ignorance at best, deluded fantasy at worst. Questions of the capability of the &amp;#8220;Spanish mind,&amp;#8221; were rampant in Europe, albeit often through innuendo. Even within Spain, some scholars lamented the fact that those conquistadors and missionaries who first encountered the Amerindian cultures were woefully inept and their testimony could not be trusted. This led some to believe that all these testimonies should be thrown out and the history to be written anew. The debate over the &amp;#8220;Spanish mind&amp;#8221; also surfaced in other forms: some believed only non-Spanish scholars should write the history of Spanish-encounters with the New World, because only they could have the appropriate detachment(or, to some, necessary intellectual ability). Some believed Spain should adopt the styles of other European scholarly communities to be taken more seriously on the international stage; others argued that Spaniards should reassert their strong humanistic heritage and take precedence in scholarship relating to the Americas. Meanwhile, the scholarly community also quarreled over whether Spaniards should be openly critical of past misconduct or if such airing of dirty-laundry would be inappropriately&amp;nbsp;unpatriotic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was actually discovered in the scripts, stones, and other documents seemed secondary to the debate behind who was doing the writing, and it was secondary in the book. There was some attention paid to it, particularly to the Amerindian development of highly complex calendric systems, but not much. This book posed some interesting questions and succeeds at demonstrating how multi-faceted the debate over the history of the New World was at this time. However, it is often repetitive, including reusing whole paragraphs from the introductions in other sections of the book, word for word. It is also often redundant in its arguments and conclusions, to the point that I feel that the book would be more successful with a general reordering of its chapters and&amp;nbsp;sub-chapters.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Doesn&amp;#8217;t the Pepsi max commercial make the Pepsi guy look like a douche? Couldn&amp;#8217;t the Coke guy get fired for having a video of him drinking a competitor&amp;#8217;s drink? If there is going to be a drink that people want a calorie free version of, wouldn&amp;#8217;t people want it to be the drink whose primary flavor isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;sugar?&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;After spending more hours than I care to calculate wading through this book, and then reading through my notes to see if the distilled version is any clearer, I have to announce that I&amp;#8217;m very disappointed by the entire endeavor.  In the first paragraph of his introduction, Jorge Canizares-Esguerra announced that the thesis of his book is that the modern attitudes in historiography originated in 18th century Spain and Spanish America, not in 19th century Germany.  But the subsequent 347 very dense pages suggest that his real goal was to show us just how very, very much research he had done.  Unfortunately, when you include so much information, it tends to bury rather than support your point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His first chapter discussed how these 18th century historians came to favor internal consistency in their resources over the credibility that comes from proximity.  If the 16th century accounts made claims that didn&amp;#8217;t support the 18th century expectations, then they were rejected.  There were a lot of other topics stuffed into the chapter as well, but that seemed to be the overall gist that was trying to peek through the verbiage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter two revolved, loosely, around how attitudes toward forms of recording texts (alphabetically, pictorially, etc.) informed various eras&amp;#8217; attitudes toward the credibility of native American primary sources.  Most Europeans believed they were unreliable because the authors were too primitive to know what they were doing, since they hadn&amp;#8217;t yet developed enough to use alphabets.  He did include other opinions, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter three explored how patriotism in Spain inspired new histories and historical projects.  But in pursuing these, they were caught between wanting to clear away images of 16th century Spanish slaughter, and not wanting to discount the accuracy of 16th century Spanish accounts of grand civilizations.  Most of their efforts went unpublished, though, so Spain never got credit for the insights and advances they contributed to the art of writing history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter four provided many, many examples of these 18th century historians and what they were doing (and how, why, when, where, with whom, against, whom, and on and on).  I think his point was to show that no matter what their topic or position relative to northern European techniques, they all agreed that credibility only resides in upper class natives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter five looked at American historians to show how they approached the investigation of some newly discovered stone calendars and the ruins of a jungle city.  Again, there was a lot of variety of opinion and technique, but they agreed that American history couldn&amp;#8217;t be accurately written by non-Americans.  The side trip through Borunda&amp;#8217;s linguistic fantasies added nothing to the discussion, and strongly reminded me of that poor mathematician in A Beautiful Mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, with no warning, the book finally ended.  His conclusion just reiterated all of the topics and examples, without really synthesizing or concluding anything.  It was done, but I didn&amp;#8217;t feel any satisfaction from finishing something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm, I guess the process of writing this entry has cleared some of the thicket.  Each of these chapters was intended to illustrate how and why his historians were, in fact, engaging in the historiographical behaviors ascribed to von Ranke and his gang a hundred years later.  I still think the book would have been better if his editor had taken a firmer position on slashing excess.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-1941747992847031321?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

And this simply because the images used to describe events looked like demons and snakes and such. Didn&amp;#8217;t the European&amp;nbsp;maps of the time also have serpents and sea creatures on them? Or, was this a decided effort by the conquering armies to break the unifying effect of a collective history? The attempts of the indigenous people to hide and protect their writings speak to the importance they gave to these manuscripts. The sad part is that these manuscripts were parceled out later to the highest bidders.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4129143196680670213-9058756642564761598?l=historical-james.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;This book was comically written and truly a joy to read.  That was sincerely unexpected as the history of the Footnote has connotations of boredom implied in the title.  Now to comment on its contents, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was in the field of the Footnote that modern historical disputes are &amp;#8220;punched out.&amp;#8221;  Grafton enlightened me of the key insult technique of &amp;#8220;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; in American historical work, which he then used in the same page to take a stab at a contemporary of his in this field of historiographical work.  This intellectual battleground gave a third level to a history book, the first being the narrative, the second the footnote, and within the footnote the fight between&amp;nbsp;historians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also does an excellent job of explaining that the purpose of the footnote today is extremely varied.  There are varying schools of thought, all methodical in respect to different pieces of information.  And so the footnote allows the historian to know &amp;#8220;the intellectual styles of different national scientific communities, the pedagogical methods of the different graduate programs, and the literary preferences of different journal editors.&amp;#8221;(pg&amp;nbsp;13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original purpose of the footnotes as they developed in historiography were to provide the reader with &amp;#8220;proof.&amp;#8221;  Through the course of Historiography however, the &amp;#8220;proof&amp;#8221; gradually found its way more and more in the main narrative of the text and the footnote took the role of supplying the sources that the historian used, so as to demonstrate where the information was gathered and show the reader that an &amp;#8220;acceptable&amp;#8221; amount of work was done to come to the conclusions that the author&amp;nbsp;developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and learning of the evolution of the footnote, and more specifically from roles that Gibbon, Ranke and De Thou&amp;nbsp;played.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve never given much thought to the humble footnote. It probably would be fair to say I&amp;#8217;ve viewed it simply as a device writers utilize &amp;#8220;to show that they have put in hours of hard work in archive and library,&amp;#8221; as Anthony Grafton puts it (referring specifically to students). Footnotes, Grafton continues, &amp;#8220;confer authority on a writer.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8216;Nuff said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in his surprisingly engaging book &amp;#8220;The Footnote: A Curious History,&amp;#8221; Grafton deftly illuminates the ways in which the form&amp;#8217;s evolution, like that of historiography as a whole, is in fact interwoven with the overlapping forces of social, political and religious history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite interesting are the stories of Ranke, Gibbon, de Thou, Kircher, Bayle and others whose works and concomitant outlooks helped shape the approaches now widely practiced. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, particularly eye-opening to me was Grafton&amp;#8217;s explanation of how footnotes can (and have) been used to perpetrate, rather than prevent, plagiarism. Less surprising was the disclosure that footnotes sometimes are compiled as a means of representing (or even misrepresenting) selected texts, so as to justify pre-established positions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not go so far as to say that I&amp;#8217;ll never again see as tedious the writing and reading of footnotes. But thanks to Grafton, I do now have an appreciation of their deeper significance.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8399157107533224051-2944080885362026244?l=bumpusjournal.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;I must confess that Footnotes were a subject I knew very little about prior to this reading, even though I use them constantly.&amp;nbsp; In &lt;u&gt;The Footnote&lt;/u&gt;,&amp;nbsp;Anthony Grafton recreates the tumultuous history of the development of the use of&amp;nbsp;footnotes and appendices.&amp;nbsp; The footnote developed&amp;nbsp;as &amp;#8220;proof&amp;#8221; of scholarly integrity through the proper recording of ones sources of information within a given work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;nbsp;found it&amp;nbsp;interesting that the author whose footnotes I&amp;#8217;ve always found most intriguing,&amp;nbsp;namely Edward Gibbon, actually disliked them and felt they detracted in some way from his work.&amp;nbsp; I also enjoyed the way in which Grafton explains Leopold von Ranke&amp;#8217;s role in solidifying the role of proper sourcing of information for our age, not only through his love of re&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: white;&#34;&gt;search, but through &lt;/span&gt;his adeptness at repelling criticism through the integrity of his work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not surprised to see that footnoting, perhaps not in its present state, but in a fashion, existed prior to the Renaissance.&amp;nbsp; Also not surprising is that religious patronage played a part, however dubiously, in footnote development.&amp;nbsp; What I was surprised about was that there has been so much controversy about the use of footnotes, what form they should take, and even if they should be used at all.&amp;nbsp; How odd that they are such an integral part of expressing our research bona fides these days, when they were treated with such contempt by such giants as Voltaire!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I&amp;#8217;d like to say, tongue in cheek, that it was funny that Anthony Grafton&amp;#8217;s &lt;u&gt;The Footnote&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;seemed to be&amp;nbsp;comprised of about half text and half footnotes.&amp;nbsp; I think this was purposeful.&amp;nbsp; I was a little disappointed not to see some of Gibbon&amp;#8217;s irreverance in them just for fun, but they were still a nice touch.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8880139849602883287-4051874532769579441?l=dixonro.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Anthony Grafton, &lt;em&gt;The Footnote: A Curious&amp;nbsp;History&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I began reading Grafton&amp;#8217;s volume I found myself constantly wondering what is the point of all this, what can an overly philosophical and seemingly menial inquiry provide to my understanding of the practice of history?  To be sure, I gained a few insights into the history of the footnote, about its ancient antecedents, its relationship to commentaries and the appendix, but I ultimately failed to understand the worth of this book.  The footnote is a technical apparatus used by a variety of writers throughout history, and it may have an interesting history (to some), but does a modern historian really need any deep insight into the philosophy of the footnote?  Is a mere understanding of its function enough to guide the historian in its effective&amp;nbsp;use?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah!  But therein lays the rub—its effective use.  Behind the multitude of examples and the discussion of methods used by ancient, medieval, renaissance, and early modern historians, Grafton addresses himself to issues which, while seemingly off topic, are useful to understanding good scholarship.  His analysis of the various forms of footnotes—such as those which provide commentary, educated debate, factual references, or the nature of sources—could spark lively debate over the appropriateness of each form and its usefulness to modern historians.  For our purposes in this course that may indeed be&amp;nbsp;necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its benefits to debate notwithstanding, I am still not satisfied with the volume.   Throughout most of the book I found myself questioning what purpose the vignettes offered about Ranke, Gibbon, and other historians served.  I found the book less of a history on the footnote and more of an examination of the scholarship of history through the last four hundred years—which absolutely bored me at times, but could also come through with no small amount of humor.  At times it seemed to me as though Grafton actually got caught up in this examination of practice rather than his stated goal of examining the footnote.  It may be, however, that his examination of the practice of history over the course of these centuries is not without merit, and it may prove a lively source of debate about practices—a goal perhaps our&amp;nbsp;instructor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only in the final segment of the book, coyly titled &amp;#8220;Some Concluding Footnotes,&amp;#8221; could I find anything which would cause me to recommend this book.  Here, the author finally ties together the loose strings from his preceding vignettes.  Here, in the conclusion Grafton finally makes an argument worth reading, asserting that is the footnote and methodologies of history which make it possible to defend against the innate desire among men and nations to keep their skeletons well hidden, so that the Truth may be known and followed back to its sources.  It may be cartoonish, but it was one of the few moments if found in this book worth&amp;nbsp;reading.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Grafton, Anthony.  &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;The Footnote&lt;/span&gt;.  Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While reading Grafton&amp;#8217;s book, I was intrigued by the long-lasting debate in the scholarly community of the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries about whether to even use footnotes at all.  Did a footnote disrupt the flow of a learned, stylistically pleasing narrative or add to the scholar&amp;#8217;s credibility and allow readers to check the work and subsequently perform their own scholarship?  A seemingly endless drama appears to have raged, with adherents from the Pantheon of Great People firmly entrenched in their positions on either side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it never seemed to have ended.  Even Ranke struggled with the question of whether or not to include citations, and from the way Grafton presents the information, printing your sources and criticism was perhaps more likely to get you heavily critiqued than not doing so, at least for a time.  Of course, we have the modern footnote today, with some rather more carefully delineated usages for it, but the question remains: do you clutter the bottom of every page with notes, some of which must by spatial necessity flow onto the next (or the next) page, or do you shift your second narrative, as Grafton views it, to the back of the book and simply denote its presence with unobtrusive numbers?  Certainly, I had noticed the difference between footnotes and endnotes before, but Grafton&amp;#8217;s book prompted me to really consider their uses for varying audiences, the members of the historical profession or a lay audience, which would be perhaps more interested in the narrative and the conclusions rather than being able to trace the author&amp;#8217;s time spent in archives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I enjoyed Grafton&amp;#8217;s book and his comments about footnotes and the way in which he uses the idea of source documentation as a sort of lens through which to view the construction of the modern historical field, I must admit that I was perplexed by the book&amp;#8217;s organization.  The word &amp;#8220;vignettes&amp;#8221; kept running through my mind while reading it, and I think I would have gotten more out of it had Grafton chosen to organize his study in a more chronological fashion, rather than choosing to leap around in time and pursue a sort of treasure hunt, on the path of the elusive footnote.  I&amp;#8217;m certainly a fan of &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;in media res&lt;/span&gt; openings, so I don&amp;#8217;t fault him for beginning with a short bit about Ranke, but overall, I felt as though I was not only reading an &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;in media res&lt;/span&gt; opening, but also an &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;imr&lt;/span&gt; middle and an &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;imr&lt;/span&gt; conclusion.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6220711600267285330-8471175764009795357?l=jawhite21.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;When I first discovered that this book was dedicated solely to the issue of footnotes, I must admit that I was not quite as excited as some of my colleagues seem to have been. Footnotes, while I have always conceded their necessity and usefulness, have never truly found a place in my historical heart. I am happy to say, however, that this book brought a new life and meaning to the footnote that has since convinced me to rethink my position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The footnote was a sadly overlooked topic at my undergraduate college, and we were taught to use it only in the modernized form that Grafton laments. I never truly understood how simplified this one-sided use of the footnote was until Grafton&amp;#8217;s text delved into the myriad ways in which the footnote has been and ought to be used. Rather than simply&amp;nbsp; being a tool to help insure historical veracity, footnotes in fact form a story of their own, one that tells as much about the author as is does the subject being discussed. Whether the footnote is in narrative form or providing supporting evidence, these brief side points allow a more personal glimpse of the author to come through than would be considered appropriate within the actual text itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much like historical thought is constantly changing and developing, the footnote too is a surprisingly fluid concept. It reflects general intellectual trends of the time and provides a strong indication of the way a particular period approached the subject of history. For as long as histories have been around, the footnote has been a proud declaration of contemporary historical values. Even the absence of footnotes provides an indication of the importance placed on historical truth, or rather the failure to do so. There was no steady path culminating in the institutionalized version of today&amp;#8217;s footnote, nor did it simply spring into existence fully formed and ready to go. The development of the footnote has taken a long time and often followed a somewhat bumpy path; progress has not always characterized its evolution and at some points it seems to have actually regressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed that this book actually had me missing the &amp;#8220;good old&amp;#8221; footnotes by its conclusion, where stories were told and jabs made. I too have noticed an increasing trend in current historiographical works to dedicate footnotes solely to providing documentation and information regarding further reading. While these are of course critical to providing a valid historical work, they lack the punch found in narrative footnotes. Ranke&amp;#8217;s great problem with footnotes was that they interrupted the text, but I find that my reading only feels interrupted when the footnotes are nothing but lines of abbreviations and numbers that take minutes to decipher. I tend to get inexplicably excited when I come across a footnote that is simply three of four lines of text, always hoping that it will provide a little side entertainment before returning to the main work. While it is not practical, or even desirable, to constrain modern usage of the footnote to its narrative form, it would be appreciated to see a little more life fed back into the bottom of the page. I doubt this will happen any time soon, however, for as Grafton points out the footnote is essential to a historian and his/her work. Although footnotes are unable to definitively prove an author&amp;#8217;s point, they provide the best reassurance we have to the veracity of a historical study and reflect the time and effort a historian put into their work. As such, the footnote is an essential tool for any professional historian and, like it or not, is around to stay.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-4732529172105592074?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Post&amp;nbsp;#1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August 29,&amp;nbsp;2010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grafton, Anthony. &lt;em&gt;The Footnote&lt;/em&gt;. Cambridge, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt;: Harvard University Press,&amp;nbsp;1997.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthony Grafton takes an incisive look at the history of the footnote and its use in historical writing. He examines the multiple uses of the footnote; to aid the reader in their scholarship, to lend legitimacy to one&amp;#8217;s work, to give credit to previous historians, and to discredit, discount, and humiliate one&amp;#8217;s academic rivals, past and present. He devotes about as much time to the last use of the footnote as he does to the historical development of the footnote, the first use of which he dates to be around 1700, if not a few years before. Grafton explains the various uses of the footnote well, and how they have been part of historical debate for centuries. He extends his focus to the historians who are using them, and he does well examining the scholars and periods of academia with a fair eye. He acknowledges both the difficulties the scholars faced and their often bloated sense of accomplishment. These brief biographies of the historians are insightful and fairly even-handed, offering both praise and addressing failures and short-comings. The strongest point of the book, I felt, was the chapter placing the footnote, finally, at its inception in the Eighteenth Century. He demonstrates the difficulties historians at that time faced to reassert the importance of history and the other humanities at the time of so many other scientific Enlightenment breakthroughs. To confirm the validation of the subject while radically changing its practice is certainly a difficult task. Grafton cites some historians&amp;#8217; articulate defense of the subject, and supports the progression of the discipline, advocating the double-narrative that historians often use&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book moves along at a decent pace and is well-written. It must be admitted that the author seems to greatly enjoy his own writing, and employs various turns-of-phrase and literary analogies, which are at times interesting side-notes, but often seemed to me to be gratuitous assertions of his own learning. To pay tribute to his multiple literary references, I think it fitting to compare him to the character of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;E. K.&lt;/span&gt; Hornbeck in &lt;em&gt;Inherit the Wind&lt;/em&gt;, a play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. Hornbeck is a Baltimore newspaper man, who writes with a clever sophistication and &amp;#8220;sneers politely at everything, including himself.&amp;#8221; That being said, for what could have been a painfully dry subject, Grafton infuses a lot of life into the narrative, with his character sketches and related stories. Using the footnote as a lens, he is able not only to reveal the development of this historical apparatus, but also to offer a look into the world of historians, and the politics surrounding the study of history in each of the centuries he&amp;nbsp;addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The most interesting section of Grafton&amp;#8217;s book is a two-page section where he describes the duty of an historian &amp;#8220;to tell the double story of the historical past and the historian&amp;#8217;s research&amp;#8221; before acknowledging that one of the primary champion&amp;#8217;s of the footnote, Leopold von Ranke,  &amp;#8220;thought that the best historical narrative was a classical one, free of notes.&amp;#8221; (pgs 67-68).  I find it interesting because  it tells the story of the great battle every historian fights: the battle between entertainment and authority. Authority, it seems, is purchased with the cost of at least some entertainment value; while the well-read historian can integrate the footnote into a narrative (or an argument) by second nature, many people get confused by or lost in the notes. Putting them at the end solves much of this; some histories have even done away with the footnote all together, dismissing them in works which they acknowledge  are meant for the non-professional audience. The assumption is, of course, that the broad public wants a story while the professional cadre demands sources. While this seems at least minimally insulting to the broad public, it seems equally dismissive of the professional, as if they are some breed of automaton who can only process information if it comes with a superscript number behind it. I wonder, though, if this really distorts the message historians are presenting to the public&amp;#8211;and I do not mean that the professional historian is imbibed  with  both certain etiquette and certain standards, which it should be&amp;#8211;  but that the historian desires a history that is not entertaining. The goal of every historical writing (I should hope) is that the joy of a subject, felt first by the historian, can be communicated through the mutual process of the narrative. Removing the footnote or the specific end note supplies another level of remove from that research which, while it may be less clumsy, takes away from the joy of learning something: that there is honest work in arriving at the&amp;nbsp;truth.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;For over a thousand years Roman conquerors returning from the wars enjoyed the honor of a triumph, a tumultuous parade. In the procession came trumpeters, musicians and strange animals from conquered territories, together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments. The conquerors rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children robed in white stood with him in the chariot or rode the trace horses. A slave stood behind the conqueror holding a golden crown above his head and whispering in his ear a warning: that all glory is&amp;nbsp;fleeting.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;Anthony Grafton provided many definitions of footnotes throughout this book, beginning with, &amp;#8220;[they] offer the empirical support for stories told and arguments supported&amp;#8221; on page vii of the preface, and ending with &amp;#8220;[they] enable[ ] historians to make their texts not monologues but conversations, in which modern scholars, their predecessors, and their subjects all take part&amp;#8221; on page 234 of the epilogue.&amp;nbsp; In between, he even referred to them in sacramental terms, on page 24.&amp;nbsp; But this book did much more than simply define or dissect the small print at the bottom of the page, the reward—or not—for breaking your attention to the main text.&amp;nbsp; He used the development of, and changing attitudes toward, footnotes as a guiding theme for looking at the evolution of historiography itself, or at least one strand of it.&amp;nbsp; By following his trail, I was led to visit several eras of thought around how to write history, and I was introduced (or re-introduced) to an entertaining variety of thinkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grafton opened his journey with a visit to Edward Gibbon, whose snarky footnotes put him in a class with Bierce, Twain, Fields, and others.&amp;nbsp; This was an appropriate beginning not only as an incentive to further explore what could have seemed an arid wasteland of parentheses and Latin abbreviations, but also because it foreshadowed Grafton&amp;#8217;s own use of witty analogies and clever wordplay.&amp;nbsp; Besides comparing footnotes to a sacrament, he mentioned Ali Baba&amp;#8217;s cave (x), swarming anthills (9), seas of lemonade (12) pigs and geese (35 and 37), thrift shops (39), armored vehicles (56), William Morris wallpaper (111), hitchhiking (135), and alchemy (199).&amp;nbsp; I very much appreciated seeing that academic writing doesn&amp;#8217;t have to consist of convoluted, passively voiced, pretentiously worded sentences.&amp;nbsp; He was clear and interesting as well as informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He seems to have two main points that he&amp;#8217;s making with his survey of footnotes throughout history.&amp;nbsp; One is that they tell a different, but equally important story than the one presented in the main text.&amp;nbsp; The text tells the history of the subject at hand, and the footnotes tell the history of creating that text above.&amp;nbsp; His other point is that our modern footnotes have a much more interesting genealogy than their current business-like practice would suggest, sort of like that Rockwell family tree, where little perfect Johnny has all sorts of interesting scalawags in his background.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s footnotes &amp;#8220;convince the reader that the historian has done an acceptable amount of work…[and] indicate the chief sources that the historian has actually used.&amp;#8221; (22) Occasionally they provide interesting additions to the main text, but often they&amp;#8217;re bare citations.&amp;nbsp; I mentally cheered when I read Hume&amp;#8217;s comment on page 103 that flipping pages only to find nothing entertaining is a frustration that needs to be remedied.&amp;nbsp; I was thinking along the lines of different typeface for the numbers that refer to citations or to commentary, but his idea of citations at the bottom and good stuff at the end would work as well.&amp;nbsp; Clearly distinguishing between the two roles of footnotes might encourage more creative use of the second role, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After beginning with Gibbon, the first chapter considered German arrogance and Positivism, then compared ancient helps to today&amp;#8217;s footnotes.&amp;nbsp; Biblical and classical glosses, fifth-century legal writings, and Peter Lombard&amp;#8217;s citations have elements in common with our current expectations, but fundamentally were included to help a limited reader approach and understand an authoritative text, not—as now—to show the ingredients of a text that has a particular and contingent perspective to add to the many valid voices on its topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sections on Ranke were dear to my librarian&amp;#8217;s heart.&amp;nbsp; Its always fun to meet someone who loves not only the treasures in an archive, but even the basic act of sifting through the detritus to find them.&amp;nbsp; And the chapter about Enlightenment excesses was wonderful.&amp;nbsp; I love the cheeky, droll, irreverent parodies he described.&amp;nbsp; They reminded me of Flanders &lt;span class=&#34;amp&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Swann, a musical duo with the same dry wit.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;d never thought about footnotes for fiction, but I like the idea, sort of like parenthetical asides on an official scale (I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of parenthetical asides).&amp;nbsp; Chapter five zipped through several people to show how respect for accuracy in the details developed over the years, even as admitting to the process of ensuring accuracy was kept hidden from the reader.&amp;nbsp; Chapter six, too, showed growth in careful scholarship still being kept behind the literary green baize door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, in chapter seven, Grafton shared the tale of Pierre Bayle&amp;#8217;s dictionary, and how it made footnotes in scholarly works not only acceptable, but even desirable.&amp;nbsp; Bayle took pride in being a compiler, not a historian, of presenting facts and sources, not opinions and conclusions.&amp;nbsp; This was fitting to the time, as authority came under such fire in the seventeenth century.&amp;nbsp; Authors, along with science, the Bible, and politics, could no longer simply state their position and expect it to be accepted simply because of their position as authority figures.&amp;nbsp; Footnotes lent them credibility by showing why they should be trusted and believed, which is a big part of their role today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the epilogue, Grafton says, &amp;#8220;Modern history is modern precisely because it tries to give a coherent literary form to both parts of the historical enterprise.&amp;#8221; (232)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; After showing the fits and starts, the shifting balance between eloquence and accuracy, and other lurching steps on the road to modern historiography, he sums up the story arc and leaves us with a few gentle warnings.&amp;nbsp; Footnotes can&amp;#8217;t do everything we expect them to, they&amp;#8217;re as prone to manipulation as are statistics, and they&amp;#8217;re currently not as stylish as they could be.&amp;nbsp; However, they are our best guarantee of reliability, they show the investigative process of writing history, and they invite readers to become participants in the joys of exploring and sharing the story of human activity.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39;

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;The pen is mightier than the sword, and the footnote is its stab to the kidneys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a slight personal bias in favor of this book, because I love footnotes and the snarky things historians sometimes insert.  I have been at conferences where I watched two scholars who have engaged in a war of footnote words act incredibly cordially to one another then mutter asides to their cohorts after they move on.  The footnote as a tool for commentary is one of the things I most enjoyed about my undergraduate education, and when I purchased Anthony Grafton&amp;#8217;s text, I was excited to learn more about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grafton makes a couple of early points that have been my own understanding of footnotes, apparently antiquated: as he says, &amp;#8220;A hundred years ago, most historians would have made a simple distinction: the text persuades, the notes prove.&amp;#8221;&lt;a style=&#34;mso-footnote-id: ftn1&#34; title=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5106592513198462604&amp;amp;postID=6337084089811826577#_ftn1&#34; name=&#34;_ftnref1&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;  This is apparently horribly outdated, as the text is where the notes and studies are stuffed, with only the barest source material in the footnotes.  I prefer the narrative nature of footnotes in someone like Gibbon, whom he rightfully lists as the master of the craft.  I like footnotes to be rich, miniature essays in their own write, exhorting me to further research on a very specific point and giving me starting materials from which to expand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The footnote changes history.  It changes the way we think about history.  The great medieval and classical histories are written by people who either experienced the events or interviewed people, or, in some cases, checked other books, but they don&amp;#8217;t systematically cite or attempt to prove—it is assumed that you trust them, which leads to things like Geoffrey of Monmouth&amp;#8217;s magnum opus.  With footnotes, as Grafton points out, you have to look at the history being written through the lens of a historian; there are credentials being stated, and a modern worldview, and a detachment.  A historian records history, he isn&amp;#8217;t the one creating it.&lt;br /&gt;The fallibility of footnotes, which Ranke dealt with in relation to Renaissance histories, is one of the things that scares me when it comes to academic texts.  I know that a good editor and publishing company will at least check to make sure that all citations are factually correct, but sometimes when delving through history texts I wonder about the myriad sources and citations.  Ranke managed to discover vast falsehoods, and I assume that the trend of scientific history has prevented the kind of widespread shenanigans exhibited in older texts, but it makes me a little paranoid at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranke&amp;#8217;s issue with the footnote mirrors one of my own.  Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong—when I read a history book as a scholar, I revel in footnotes.  I like to write them down, and go look up the other sources and suggestions later to further my own education, and I enjoy the discussion of methodology, historiography, etc. that can accompany them.  That being said, I sympathize with Ranke&amp;#8217;s plight, and I sometimes wish for the unbroken narrative given by older, footnote-less texts.  The use of appendices and endnotes can mitigate this to some degree, and I&amp;#8217;ve read a number of popular-format history books that do this.   In the end, I&amp;#8217;m of split minds, because the scholar half of me hates to be without copious footnotes, but the reader prefers it greatly.&lt;br /&gt;I love how Grafton takes the history of the footnote, and the history of history attached to it, and traces us back through a series of famous figures that I&amp;#8217;ve actually heard of to explore how long historians have been obsessed with factuality, with delving into primary sources and supporting their work.  While they may have been exceptions within their own time, I have been under the impression that carefully documented history was a modern obsession solely, a product of the need to prove the workload that went into an article or a monographs creation.  Happily, this was a false assumption, and the footnote, or at least document-based history of the critical and well-supported nature, goes back through the early modern period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book does a number of important things.  Firstly, it forces the reader to reevaluate the purpose, history, and meaning of footnotes.  They are not just dry citations, but an entire discussion within themselves that speaks volumes about the authors training, methods, ideological approach, and in the best of them, his rivalries within his field.  Secondly, it provides a good historiography of historical scholarship, in its many forms and stretching from the modern era back to the antiquarians of the 16th-17th century, and tracing back to antiquity to look at the ways in which the Greco-Roman world did history.  As a book, it is a fine introduction to historiography all on its own.  Thirdly, it shows how vital archival work and delving into primary sources really is.  I&amp;#8217;ve always been excited about the idea of finding new things to write about, but this book made it very clear how vital actually going to archives is, not just trusting republications of them.  Connected to this is a paranoia about secondary sources, that you must carefully analyze every source you come into contact with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grafton laments the decline of the footnote into glorified citations, a sad fate for such an interesting means of communicating information.  If nothing else, this interesting book has me promising  not waste good footnotes on such a boring purpose—cite, yes, but comment as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style=&#34;mso-footnote-id: ftn1&#34; title=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5106592513198462604&amp;amp;postID=6337084089811826577#_ftnref1&#34; name=&#34;_ftn1&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; Anthony Grafton, The Footnote (Cambridge, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt;: Harvard &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;UP&lt;/span&gt;, 1997), 15.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-6337084089811826577?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;While reading Grafton&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;The Footnote,&amp;#8221; I came across this, &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;historians perform two complementary tasks. They must examine all the sources relevant to the solution of a problem and construct a new narrative or argument from them.&amp;#8221; (4, 5) He also went on to say that use of footnotes &amp;#8220;identifies the work of history in question as the creation of a professional.&amp;#8221; This spoke to me as it related to what we discussed in class last Monday. How are we as emerging historians to show that we truly belong to this guild? Mathematicians use proofs of mathematical formulas, or postulates. Doctors site case studies of diseases and cures to show they are correct in what they are saying. We have the written records and documents. Why a person did this or that can be ascertained by what was said to witnesses and what the person himself may have written. All the while we are never forgetting that those telling the story are infusing their own view as well, or are aware that posterity will use their words for its own interpretation. Still, Grafton returns to the idea that &amp;#8220;footnotes serve to prove the author&amp;#8217;s membership in a guild rather than to illuminate or support a particular point.&amp;#8221; (108) It simply shows that we have done the legwork to find information on the topic upon which we are expounding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More to follow&amp;#8230;&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;img width=&#39;1&#39; height=&#39;1&#39; src=&#39;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4129143196680670213-7123135193940697042?l=historical-james.blogspot.com&#39; alt=&#39;&#39; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                                &lt;p&gt;First reading for my 510 class, William Cronon&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Getting Ready to Do&amp;nbsp;History.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, I was intrigued by the opening question of what a historian actually does, because I have in the past fallen into the category of those who would have just said &amp;#8220;study history&amp;#8221; and moved on. Really, I know that was a simplistic answer, but I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have bothered to go any further into what I actually mean about that. His long bulleted list of what historians do, the things that link them, and the sketch of what I should, to a certain extent, begin thinking about as a new historian (new as in length of time doing it, rather than the historical school of thought). The last couple of points, especially the continuing emphasis on narrative storytelling, made me very happy, because history is fun and exciting, and should be written that way—a good history book is just as fun to read as any&amp;nbsp;fiction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also struck by the acknowledgement that history is written distinctly from our modern perspective, that we are constructing history based on our own views, and that this is ok and how we should and will operate. My teachers discussed history not in terms of objectivity but interpretation, but they did try to convince me that my own biases were bad and I should work to defeat them within my own text. I appreciate that it is understood that my bias is part of my text, and that honestly it is an important part. My history texts, my writings, are in the end valuable as a history of my lifetime and my particular context, because my biases and how they come out in my text are important markers of our&amp;nbsp;culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When reading about the Ph.D. Octopus, I was reminded of a graphic distinction I just&amp;nbsp;saw:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://gizmodo.com/5613794/what-is-exactly-a-doctorate?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+gizmodo/full+(Gizmodo)&#34;&gt;What Exactly Is A&amp;nbsp;Doctorate?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss the era of the Renaissancce Man, where the mark of a good education was being deeply educated in a wide variety of areas. I would love to be able to get Ph.D.&amp;#8217;s in several areas, or at least Master&amp;#8217;s programs, or something of that nature. While I do have a passion for the area of history I am going into, I wish it were acceptable and practical to continue dabbling through higher education. At the same time, you do become theoretically the master of your chosen field, the absolute top scholar in a very narrow area. I know that the techniques I am learning/will learn will allow me to pick up any knowledge I care to study later, I agree that it stifles a bit of creativity within the bureaucratic undertaking of actually getting the&amp;nbsp;doctorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this article on the whole heartening about the profession and the way it is being thought of. I come from a school with more narrow views on the future of history and the historians, and reading this article I felt that there is a very good sense of the vastness of possibility within somewhat fixed but generally free boundaries. While the guild structure of the historian is a real thing, I feel that the guild is shifting, that new types of history and old are both alive and well, and that the community I am entering is one that I will be able to adapt to&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
