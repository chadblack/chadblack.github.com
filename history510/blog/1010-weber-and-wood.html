<p>I found this week&#8217;s economic readings much more interesting than those of the previous weeks, likely because the books this week had a stronger cultural emphasis to which I could respond.  On one hand, I rather wish we had read these two works, or at least  Wood&#8217;s, as the first foray into economic history, as it clarified  several points for me.  On the other hand, I can see how her reading  would have biased us about the other works (and of course, if she&#8217;s  going to discuss Marx, it helps to have read some of his writings in  advance).  Also, I am unable to say whether I understood her work better  because it was written on more of an intro level, or because I <span style="font-style: italic;">had</span> been previously and recently exposed to some of the concepts she is discussing and the theories against which she is arguing.<br /><br />Weber&#8217;s exploration of the capitalist spirit as it intersects with religion was intriguing, if outdated (oh, sociology-type writings from the early 1900s&#8230;).  His idea that the spirit of capitalism originated in the asceticism of Protestant religions, with the combination of the concept of a &#8220;calling&#8221; and doing your work on earth to please a god, was interesting, if unconvincing.  I would have preferred if he had expounded on his views about Catholicism, as they contrast to those about Protestantism&#8212;it would have created a stronger foundation, I feel, for his conclusions.  In reading his descriptions of the four Protestant religions under study, I found the one about Calvinism to be the most developed and lucid.  The remaining three seem to be shorter and less developed, largely since they play off all the ideas already set down for Calvinism, but I still found them lacking.  I came away from the Calvinist description with a strong understanding of how it might contribute to the &#8220;Protestant work ethic,&#8221; as Weber sees it, but I was left unsure with the remaining three.<br /><br />Wood&#8217;s goal is to situate the development of capitalism in a specific time and location, with specific causes, and I admire her for doing so.  Not being very familiar with economic history, I am unable to comment on her views that most economic historians either take the origins of capitalism for granted or explain them by virtue of capitalism existing, in a begging-the-question fashion.  Her book argues strongly against the idea that history ended with the fall of the <span class="caps">USSR</span>, as we discussed last week; her idea that capitalism originated under specific circumstances implies that a new economic system could begin, given the right situation.  I felt the last part the book deteriorated when she began discussing the role of capitalism in imperial societies and in the modern world.    As to the length of the updated edition, which she discusses, I am torn.  The book is rather repetitive with its assertions, especially in the beginning when she repeatedly critiques previous explanations of capitalism.  While this was somewhat irritating, it was also helpful, as she continually reminded the reader about her thesis.  (Additionally, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen the words &#8220;fetters&#8221; used so much in one book before&#8212;I kept wanting to tell her to find a thesaurus somewhere&#8230;)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6220711600267285330-8922751818859422138?l=jawhite21.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
