<p>When I first began reading <i>Confronting Historical Paradigms</i>, I&nbsp; expected to encounter a strong anti-Marxian critique that systematically proved the fallibility of his economic and historical theory. What is actually contained within this book is much different and, to my surprise, much more enjoyable. Taken as a whole, the book would be somewhat lengthy and difficult to slough through due to the detailed information contained within its pages. It is clear that each contributing author is intimately familiar with their particular subject and that knowledge comes through in sometimes overwhelming force. Fortunately, <i>Confronting Historical Paradigms</i> is a collection of individual essays confronting the imposition of dominant historical paradigms onto non-Western countries and arguing for the advent of new paradigms that allow for greater variability. The book&#8217;s division into self-contained chapters makes it much easier to get through, as well as keeping it interesting by providing several different opinions on the same general topic. Overall, I found this book to be engaging, thought-provoking and above all persuasive in its claims.<br /><br />I found the first main chapter of the book, that by Steve Stern, to be one of the most interesting sections. His focus on Latin America highlighted many of the limitations of Marxian economic theory when applied to non-Western countries, particularly through the two case studies he provides. I also found his critique of other systematic historical paradigms to be rather enlightening, notably his critical assessment of Wallerstein&#8217;s theory of a world system. I found myself in complete agreement with his assertion that history is simply too complex and varied to be explained with a single paradigm. This is even more true when that paradigm is derived from the experiences of Western Europe and then forcibly applied elsewhere, regardless of applicability. This section once again emphasized the Euro-centric aspect of much historical scholarship and the limitations of such a development. Stern does a convincing job at explaining why existing historical paradigms are insufficient for some areas of historical study, although he does not really provide a valid alternative. Marxist theory in particular does not work because, according to Stern, his system does not incorporate all aspects of historical life, such as peasants and peasantries. A more specific approach is needed to truly understand Latin American history. <br /><br />&nbsp;The chapter by Frederick Cooper on Africa and the World Economy was also rather enjoyable, although a little more difficult to get through due to the huge amount of information compressed into a few pages. Thankfully, Cooper provides a brief overview of the three primary historical paradigms used for studying African history, a decision I appreciated as someone who is somewhat unfamiliar with theoretical studies of Africa. Cooper main contention against existing paradigms differed from Sterns; Cooper argues that these models do not provide a deep enough analysis and such questions as why, for whom and at who&#8217;s expense need to be addressed more thoroughly. Cooper does not have an issue with looking at Africa as a whole; in fact, he asserts that is it appropriate to study Africa in context with the world economy because of its undeniable influence on African history. However, whatever system is used needs to be more flexible than those in existence. According to Cooper, and I found myself in full agreement, the Marxist system is too mechanical and does not allow for changes and variances. I was particularly interested in his section on the different development rates of capitalism and how some precursors actually hindered its development. I think one of his biggest criticisms of Marx, although he does not come out and say this, rests with the impersonal nature of Marxist history. His theory simply does not allow for much human agency, particularly on the part of peasants. <br /><br />Chapter 4 by Allen Isaacman focuses almost exclusively on the difficult role of placing peasants in history. I found Isaacman&#8217;s defense for greater incorporation of peasant studies to be persuasive. For me, at least, this chapter was also just an enjoyable and interesting read from the very beginning with his discussion on the complications involved in the term peasant. I was also surprised to find a strong Foucaultian influence throughout this section as well, although after reading it I believe that this particular approach was an excellent decision and added a great deal of depth to his argument. It was interesting to think about peasants not as a unified class, but as a much more complex social group that experienced both interclass and intraclass struggles. Isaacman also made a good point in his explanation for the history of peasant studies and the changes it has undergone in recent years as well as some of its limitations: evidence. The type of evidence a historian utilizes determines to a great extent&nbsp; what conclusions will be drawn. In stark contrast to Marx, Isaacman believes that it is necessary to use a much more localized approach to historical study; he believes there are simply too many variations and anomalies within peasant life for a single system to apply. <br /><br />The last main chapter of the book, that by William Roseberry, was my least favorite. Although he made some interesting points, I did not enjoy his approach as much those taken by the other authors. He provided a thorough examination of the <i>structure</i> of agrarian questions rather than looking at some of the questions and their results, which I would have been more interested in on a personal level. Theoretically, however, this section was enlightening and certainly expanded my appreciation for agrarian history. Like Roseberry, I would agree that agrarian history should be incorporated within the larger historical narrative in order to provide a more complete picture. One of the most interesting points of Roseberry&#8217;s argument was his critique of Marxist theory. He argues, correctly I believe, that the dominance of Marxist history has pervaded history to the point that many scholars do not question the application of his ideas and categories. These categories, however, are not always appropriate and are certainly not applicable to Latin American peasantries. It is wrong for them to be lumped into a class context against a capitalist versus non-capitalist background, for this particular approach fails to accurately grasp the nature of agrarian societies. <br /><br />This books was both an interesting, enjoyable and insightful read. It was refreshing to see so many convincing arguments against the Marxist theory, particularly ones that provided what I believe to be a fuller historical approach. I also enjoyed the variance of ideas proposed within the book&#8217;s pages; instead of one critique expounded upon by contributing authors, each provided an individual refutement of Marxist ideas based upon knowledge of their particular subject. For me, this made the book much more engaging and, I think, convincing overall. I put <i>Confronting Historical Paradigms</i> down conscious of the importance of regionalized variations, the importance of human agency and the many ways in which different historical paradigms interact to propel new advancements in the methodological approach to historical study.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-3908440234912937521?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
