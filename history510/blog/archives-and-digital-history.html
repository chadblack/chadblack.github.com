<p>Burton, Archive Stories | Cohen <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Rosenzweig, Digital&nbsp;History</p>

<p>This week&#8217;s selection of essays in Burton&#8217;s work really hammers home a very large point: that archives are not infallible. The archive is man-made entity and, as such, it is capable of as many faults as man. Because archives are created by imperfect men and states or other organizations, they are not perfect and the mechanisms for determining what documents are catalogued and preserved is highly political. For those with a background in public history, this is really nothing new. In the course of learning archival methodologies the door is opened for a brief glimpse into the very political world of accessioning and de-accessioning items or collections. From the historian&#8217;s perspective, however, it is always helpful to remember that the archive only holds those records which were purposefully placed within—it is not the complete&nbsp;record.</p>

<p>The first group of essays deals with the experiences of historians in various archives throughout the world from a first person point of view. Presented here are the many obstacles (both bureaucratic and procedural) that hampered and assisted as historians struggled to complete their researches. From this first handful of essays, it is clear that the archive is more than a repository of information: it is a living, breathing organism that is responsive to its own circumstances. The second set of essays tells the stories of the formation of various archives—from national repositories to archives in Kohler, Wisconsin that document architectural plans of sites that were never constructed. From this it is obvious that archives exist for more than one reason, as such they can provide us with more than one answer to those questions we seek to&nbsp;answer.</p>

<p>The final section presents the archive as current political force. The inclusion of particular items and the conscious exclusion of others represent a deliberate attempt to control the narratives of history. To be sure, none of the authors in this section are against highly critical and selective practices of accessioning items to archival collections; rather they assert that politics have too frequently been involved in the process to the detriment of certain historical traditions—particularly those of indigenous peoples and the lower classes. Oral histories are virtually nonexistent many western archives unless they are part of a specific research&nbsp;program.</p>

<p>As they presently exist, I think Burton would argue that archives are wholly inaccessible to most non-archivists and non-historians. Because the general public does not understand the fundamental contingency of the accessioning process, there is this belief that the archive is objective and presents the full record. Without question the archive does not present the full narrative of any line of research. Our sources are never innocent—they are products of their time and of their writer; so too are our archives. As historians we must be cognizant of these innate flaws in the archive and adjust our researches&nbsp;accordingly.</p>

<p>Without question, technology has greatly enhanced the research capabilities of modern historians; the internet connects us to various institutions and organizations to investigate their archival holdings; computers have decreased the time necessary to search a collection catalogue for particular items that may be of use; digital archives have made it unnecessary to physically visit an archive to perform research. The presence of digital and online archival resources such as the Valley of the Shadow Project (an online archive of documents pertaining to the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War) have made it possible for scholars and amateurs alike to gain first-hand knowledge of the sources that inform our&nbsp;interpretations.</p>

<p>To the extent that the authors want to make Digital History a guide book for preparing and organizing digital archives, they have succeeded. Their work is very practical and still quite applicable today. One area that I particularly liked was their discussion of copyright and fair use practices. Their very strict construction of copyright laws belies academia&#8217;s adherence to the published word. The biggest problem with fair use today is the fact that it so little understood by copyright holders, users of copyrighted material, and the general&nbsp;public.</p>

<p>The authors make a compelling case for the use of the internet as a research tool. Technology has democratized access to information and the ability to publish opinions and interpretations. To traditionalists, I think this is the biggest problem. The internet makes it much easier to spread junk history. The fair approach the authors take, however, makes it much easier to consider their argument. The internet holds great possibilities for historians, particularly as archives are digitized and made accessible via the&nbsp;internet.</p>
