<p>The collection <em>Archive Stories: Facts, Fictions and the Writing of History</em>, edited by Antoinette Burton, is a gem of a text certain to enthrall students and historians alike, ignite the flames of interest in the lay person, and, one hopes, provoke a new generation to delve into the archives. The fifteen essays contained within take the reading on a whirlwind geographical tour, dealing with archives from Paris to Uzbekistan, British Columbia to South Africa, and cross the modern period, from archival foundations in 19th century Europe to modern court cases in late 20th century British Columbia, and everywhere in between. The wide, friendly scope of this work gives it an accessibility and sweep that do not detract from its central argument: archives are constructs and historical documents in their own write, and as such have to be treated as an object of history no less than as a historical resource.<br /><br /><em>Archive Stories</em> is divided into three larger units, introduced by a short essay from Burton. Burton&#8217;s introduction brings to the forefront the need for archive stories, &#8220;narratives about how archives are created, drawn upon, and experienced by those who use them to write history,&#8221; as part of a greater program to change the perception of the archive as a static bastion of objective fact. As she points out, this is not a new concept; Jorge Canizares-Esguerra, whose work <em>How to Write the History of the New World</em> is repeatedly mentioned throughout the essays in the book, does a superb job demonstrating the multifaceted process that goes into constructing an archive, both in the political sphere and the historical one. After briefly describing the coming essays, Burton ends her introduction with a reminder of the need for a &#8220;de-bunking&#8221; of the notion that the archive encapsulates the means to determine Truth; a problem made clear as &#8220;the fetish of the archive as a surveillance apparatus has been matched in recent years by the fantasy that history is or can be a delivery system for absolute truth.&#8221;<br /><br />The first section, entitled &#8220;Close Encounters: The Archive as Contact Zone,&#8221; could just have easily been named &#8220;Stories in Archives,&#8221; as the section deals with the personal experience of six historians in various archives across the world. This is by far the most fun section of the book, as professional historians give details of their interactions with archives themselves, the archivists, foreign cultures and bureaucracies, idiosyncrasies in protocol, and myriad other obstacles, aids, and adventures in their endeavors. The overarching narrative of these six works is that archives are clearly not storehouses for objective fact, but living entities that change and mutate due to sociopolitical circumstances of the nation around them.<br /><br />The first essay in the text, Durba Ghosh&#8217;s &#8220;National Narratives and the Politics of Miscegenation: Britain and India,&#8221; does an exemplary job of pointing out the politics of archival work. Ghosh experienced two extremely different responses to her work on miscegenation between British colonial men and Indian women, and the responses form a backdrop to a larger challenge of archive work. In Britain, her project was well-received, with librarians, archivists, and scholars leaping to tell her their own connections to the project; they used their personal experiences of family members marrying Indian women as a marker of a greater cosmopolitan identity. This willingness on the part of the people was met, however, with silence from the archives, which had deliberately left out records of the native women. In India, the position was even worse, with &#8220;many archivists and librarians den[ying] that native women became sexually involved with European men,&#8221; and further absences in the archives. Ghosh ended up having to work from tangential evidence, and even novels, in order to garner evidence of something that was known and acknowledged to have happened. Archives, through their absences as much as their collections, shape history in ways that are defined by social, cultural and political motivations.<br /><br />The other five essays reinforce this point. Jeff Sahadeo&#8217;s essay &#8220;Without the Past there is no Future: Archives, History, and Authority in Uzbekistan,&#8221; looks at the archives from a political context, where repressive regimes in Uzbekistan have used the archival materials, and denial to them, as a means of political control and creation of legitimacy. In the process, he also takes a look at the very different living and working conditions faced by non-Western archivists and scholars in countries where history is a weapon used by the state, and where the economy cannot support historians in the manner customary in the West. Craig Robertson&#8217;s and Tony Ballantine&#8217;s essays continue on this trend, looking at exclusion from the archives, personal politics, and disused sources. These essays give useful tips for how to deal with archival work on a political level, but also on the neglect of certain sources from an academic standpoint, and how this can affect their future use.<br /><br />The last two essays in the first section, while still dealing with the research of individual scholars, look beyond the traditional vision of the archive to delve into oral history and cyberspace. Horacio N. Roque Ramirez&#8217;s essay &#8220;A Living Archive of Desire: Teresita la Campesina and the Embodiment of Queer Latino Community Histories,&#8221; is not as effective of a work as many of the others, dealing with oral history archives in the form of one woman&#8217;s life story, memories, and personal narrative. The main idea, of oral history being like an archive, and one that can and should be read as such, is perfectly valid, but by only using a single person as an archive, it is not as powerful as marker of the use of oral archives as Adele Perry&#8217;s &#8220;The Colonial Archive on Trial: Possession, Dispossession, and History in <em>Delgamuukw v. British Columbia</em>,&#8221; in the third section of the book. Perry&#8217;s text also looks at oral history archives, but looks at a much larger scale, and in more depth the system of organization, remembrance, and use in a cultural context. Ramirez&#8217;s essay is still an interesting look into Latino queer culture, and this particular personage&#8217;s narrative, but as an exploration into oral archives, it falls a little flat.<br /><br />The final essay, Renee Sentilles&#8217;s &#8220;Toiling in the Archives of Cyberspace,&#8221; is an especially useful piece, looking at the internet as an archive and how that reshapes traditional notions of scholarship. Perhaps the most useful question she raises is the idea of permanence when it comes to Internet sources; in her own research, talking about some four hundred websites which disappeared in a single year, she writes &#8220;I cannot find them; it is as if they never existed, yet I documented them in an earlier essay. Given traditional reasons for why we note source material (the reader must always be able to go back and review the information source), was my previous Internet research valid?&#8221; This essay is one of the most useful and thought-provoking in the book, pointing out both the need to use the Internet, its potential applications, and its incredible expansion of scholarship (both good and bad), as well as the ways in which it will transform current modes of citation and archival thought.<br /><br />The second section of the book, titled &#8220;States of the Art: &#8216;Official&#8217; Archives and Counter-Histories,&#8221; is easily thought of as &#8220;Stories of Archives.&#8221; The six essays in this section look at archives and their history/construction, rather than taking the view of an individual researcher and their archival experience. The first two, Jennifer Milligan&#8217;s &#8220;&#8216;What is an Archive?&#8217; in the History of Modern France&#8221; and Peter Fritzsche&#8217;s &#8220;The Archive and the Case of the German Nation,&#8221; look at the construction of national archives in France and Germany and the political implications of both their construction and usage. These are fairly standard pieces, useful and informative, but hardly groundbreaking&#8212;national archives exist for specific reasons, and tell specific narratives about the nation and their creators. The third essay, John Randolph&#8217;s &#8220;On the Biography of the Bakunin Family Archive,&#8221; follows a similar vein, though it is innovative enough in its idea of taking the genre of biography to the archive as a means of constructing identity.<br /><br />The second part of this section steps outside of these more traditional ways of examining archives to look at archives outside the usual spectrum. Laura Mayhall&#8217;s essay &#8220;Creating the &#8216;Suffragette Spirit&#8217;: British Feminism and the Historical Imagination&#8221; examines how archives can create a fiction where one particular facet of society, a movement, a life, whatever is emphasized to the point of being the sole reality available in the archive, a cautionary tale to researchers not to assume archives represent the full truth. Kathryn Oberdeck&#8217;s essay, &#8220;Archives of the Unbuilt Environment: Documents and Discourses of Imagined Space in Twentieth-Century Kohler, Wisconsin,&#8221; goes even further to examine the archives of a city that only partially exists, looking at architectural designs and urban plans that never came into fruition. This essay was, in my mind, possibly the most useful in the entire book&#8212;the archives of Kohler are filled with documents concerning places that never existed off paper; documents do not necessarily correlate with material reality, and the objectivist notions attached to archives in the popular mind are therefore even more dangerous than sometimes imagined. Marilyn Booth&#8217;s essay, the final one in this section, examines the archive of fiction writing and how it can relate to history. On the heels of Oberdeck&#8217;s work, it helps to show the point that material reality is not the sole judge of the use of an archive&#8212;the never-realized plans, the fiction novels of a Lebanese feminist, both tell a great deal about the world they were constructed in.<br /><br />The final section of the book, &#8220;Archive Matters: The Past in the Present,&#8221; is really a series of &#8220;Stories by Archives.&#8221; The three essays at the end examine the effect archives have upon the present, mostly in the political arena. Helena Pohlandt-McCormick focuses on South African archives of the Soweto Uprising, Adele Perry on the <em>Delgamuukw v. British Columbia</em> legal case, and Ann Curthoys on the eradication of the Tasmanian Aborigines, but all three are merely looking at facets of the greater problem of what archives say to the present day. Pohlandt-McCormick shows the systematic obfuscation of the truth in apartheid South African archives, the selective inclusion of sources in order to render a particular verdict to future generations, as well as the deliberate destruction of files deemed incriminating. Perry looks at how Western scholars privilege the written archive, ignoring the oral archives of the First Nations to the detriment of those of non-European descent, something explored thoroughly in Canizares-Esguerra&#8217;s book which she references. Curthoys look at the historiographical debate over the fate of the Tasmanians, and how various readings of the archives from particular political agendas can give widely different views.<br /><br />The importance of this final section ties the entire book together. The first two sections raise important questions about the nature of archives, their use, their origins, etc., but it is only in the third section, where the flaws of common understandings of archives are displayed in a very real, very political sphere, that the scope of this book becomes clear. Burton has created a collection that urges a redefining of the archive, not only on the level of what constitutes an archive, but in the thought-process behind archival work. Archives can no longer be considered repositories of facts, but need to be seen for the constructs they are, historical artifacts in their own right to be interpreted by historians. Only when this has occurred can they be properly used, not just by historians, but by politicians and the public.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-8853144007787274275?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
