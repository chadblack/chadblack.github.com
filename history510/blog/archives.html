<p>The readings for this week discuss the historians experience working with archives, both the materials and the institution. Archive Stories is a collection of essays that each relate one historian&#8217;s experience when researching in an archive. It discusses discrimination and restricted access from archivists or government officials, gender discrimination, nationalism and national narratives, changing political regimes, the benefit of oral histories, the changing role of archives throughout history, etc. It is clear that archives are not neutral repositories of fact, but rather are organized, accessed, and preserved in necessarily limited ways. Thus our own work as historians needs to acknowledge not only the debt we owe to archival collections, but also the lens through which we work due to an archival filter before our own interpretation of the documents even begins(other than the fact that we have decided to look for them, thus bestowing some value onto them as potential sources.) The decision to keep particular documents through generations, and possibly changes in archival leadership, represents particular choices about the value of the document each time it is preserved( even if, in some cases, the author wrote &#8220;to be burned&#8221; in the&nbsp;margin.) </p>

<p>The keepers to these collections also make choices about individual scholars and projects, as certain projects may received more support and others may be left to flounder. Some information about sources is clouded even before it comes to the archive. We like to think there is certainty about all the sources we find, but even this cannot be assured, as some documents and artifacts come to archives in mysterious ways. During my internship at the Baseball Hall of Fame, I spoke with various curators who lamented the fact that some very interesting 3D artifacts were left at the front door with no further explanation. It takes highly trained people to narrow down the historical context of a unique item, but the story of the particular artifact itself can still not be known for&nbsp;sure. </p>

<p>Digital History: A Guide to Gathering, Preserving, and Presenting the Past on the Web, was an interesting supplement, as it continues the discussion of the role of archives and how they are formatted into the twentieth first century. Living in the information age, the possibility of (close to) a full record of events is closer than ever, and the capacity for storage of digital material is greater than would have been imagined even decades ago. However, digital records are not permanent, nor are they as unrestricted as some believe. In fact, sometimes I wonder if our quick ability to access such a broad swath of information makes us ultimately less curious about information not available on the web. Do we assume the world is really at our fingertips? I think there is some weight to both sides of the argument that the internet may be the new beginning and the end of investigative inquiry. The authors take a middle position and offer the pragmatic consideration that the internet is a tool and not the only one, which can be further sharpened and&nbsp;refined.</p>

<p>In addition, we are living in a time when anyone can post on the internet(and anyone does, including this student), so the credibility of sources comes under new scrutiny. We also may now be burdened with too much information, as &#8220;mastery&#8221; of relevant literature may now be impossible by older standards. Still, technology continues to develop, so some drawbacks of internet searching and publishing may yet be remedied. It also provides some exciting opportunities for historical records and scholarship, as evidenced by the September 11 case study. In the wake of that tragic event, hundreds of thousands of people posted their stories on the few sites mentioned in this book alone. Millions more have recorded and shared their perceptions and remembrances of the days event online. Thus, the historians of the future will have unprecedented depth from which to draw in writing their attempts at informed description and analysis of that generation-defining event.  This is just one example; there are many others related the ability to share information around the&nbsp;world.</p>
