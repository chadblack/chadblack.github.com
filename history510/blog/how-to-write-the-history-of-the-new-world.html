<p>After spending more hours than I care to calculate wading through this book, and then reading through my notes to see if the distilled version is any clearer, I have to announce that I&#8217;m very disappointed by the entire endeavor.  In the first paragraph of his introduction, Jorge Canizares-Esguerra announced that the thesis of his book is that the modern attitudes in historiography originated in 18th century Spain and Spanish America, not in 19th century Germany.  But the subsequent 347 very dense pages suggest that his real goal was to show us just how very, very much research he had done.  Unfortunately, when you include so much information, it tends to bury rather than support your point.<br /><br />His first chapter discussed how these 18th century historians came to favor internal consistency in their resources over the credibility that comes from proximity.  If the 16th century accounts made claims that didn&#8217;t support the 18th century expectations, then they were rejected.  There were a lot of other topics stuffed into the chapter as well, but that seemed to be the overall gist that was trying to peek through the verbiage.<br /><br />Chapter two revolved, loosely, around how attitudes toward forms of recording texts (alphabetically, pictorially, etc.) informed various eras&#8217; attitudes toward the credibility of native American primary sources.  Most Europeans believed they were unreliable because the authors were too primitive to know what they were doing, since they hadn&#8217;t yet developed enough to use alphabets.  He did include other opinions, though.<br /><br />Chapter three explored how patriotism in Spain inspired new histories and historical projects.  But in pursuing these, they were caught between wanting to clear away images of 16th century Spanish slaughter, and not wanting to discount the accuracy of 16th century Spanish accounts of grand civilizations.  Most of their efforts went unpublished, though, so Spain never got credit for the insights and advances they contributed to the art of writing history.<br /><br />Chapter four provided many, many examples of these 18th century historians and what they were doing (and how, why, when, where, with whom, against, whom, and on and on).  I think his point was to show that no matter what their topic or position relative to northern European techniques, they all agreed that credibility only resides in upper class natives. <br /><br />Chapter five looked at American historians to show how they approached the investigation of some newly discovered stone calendars and the ruins of a jungle city.  Again, there was a lot of variety of opinion and technique, but they agreed that American history couldn&#8217;t be accurately written by non-Americans.  The side trip through Borunda&#8217;s linguistic fantasies added nothing to the discussion, and strongly reminded me of that poor mathematician in A Beautiful Mind.<br /><br />And then, with no warning, the book finally ended.  His conclusion just reiterated all of the topics and examples, without really synthesizing or concluding anything.  It was done, but I didn&#8217;t feel any satisfaction from finishing something.<br /><br />Hmmm, I guess the process of writing this entry has cleared some of the thicket.  Each of these chapters was intended to illustrate how and why his historians were, in fact, engaging in the historiographical behaviors ascribed to von Ranke and his gang a hundred years later.  I still think the book would have been better if his editor had taken a firmer position on slashing excess.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-1941747992847031321?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
