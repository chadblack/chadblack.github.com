<p>Historical materialism operates from the fundamental assessment that history itself is not the collective actions and motives of individuals or groups, but that history is the collective tale of how mankind creates and recreates the material requirements of life.  Indeed, the only thing that serves to separate man from the lower animals is the ability to produces the means of survival.  In order to carry out the production of the means of survival, people enter into a society governed by their interactions regarding the means of production.  Therefore, history is driven by the social context of communal living—more precisely the economics of&nbsp;production. </p>

<p>The social structure—the context of community—presupposes a larger superstructure known as the state in which serves to enforce the communal good over the individual good and regulate the interactions of production.  Ultimately this generates a group consciousness, but this group consciousness is removed from the individual and exists only as a part of his interactions with other men and serves to delude him into accepting his&nbsp;plight. </p>

<p>As society develops, the relations of production become more complex, but they are firmly rooted in a growing division of labor and control of production by outside forces.  By the time capitalism emerges, civilization as moved beyond slavery and feudal serfdom, but the control of production is tightly controlled by capitalists, who are the heirs to feudal lords, as they privately own the means of production and commerce.  The more refined the system of production becomes, the more stratified society becomes and the smaller the class of controllers of production becomes.   The producers are reduced to wage laborers who exchange their energy for a meager subsistence represented by the artificial value of money which is exchanged for the means of survival, thus creating wage&nbsp;slaves. </p>

<p>The principles of Marxist history seem to be easily broken down to a few simple tenets: (1) human society is based on the production of the means of subsistence, (2) the division of labor generates social classes based on type of labor performed, (3) production is based on the technology available, and (4) society evolves over time with modes of production and will eventually end in a socialist state.  Within this framework, then, history is relegated to class conflict, wherein the produces are continually struggling against those who own the means of production.   Society can only evolve when the lower classes challenge the superstructure of society.  The end result is revolution in favor of the&nbsp;proletariat. </p>

<p>If one were to sum up Marx&#8217;s theory of history in a single sentence it might read thus: history is the story of class conflict over the means of production.  According to Marx, civilization develops along a set path determined by the technology of production and the relationship between producers and owners of production.  Ultimately, Marx postulates that this path will eventually lead to a socialist revolution.   Does this mean, then that Marxist history is utopian in its outlook?  How is this truly different from the Universal History of Kant and&nbsp;Hegel? </p>

<p>Hegel suggests that the central arc of history is to be found in the freedom of the spirit; that history is the study of freedom with given cultures.  Freedom, Hegel, asserts begins as a privilege of despots, which is transferred to a privilege of the few, and ultimately ends in a widespread realization that humanity is free in and of itself (a civilization wherein all enjoy liberty).   Kant suggests that the driving force of history is found in reason.  He suggests that history can be seen as the realization of Nature&#8217;s plan for perfection.  Thus, Kant says history is the story of progress towards an unknown, but rational&nbsp;future. </p>

<p>If we ignore Kant&#8217;s valorization of an unknown future state and Hegel&#8217;s conception of freedom as best enforced within constitutional monarchies, what difference is to be found as one moves towards Marx?  Marx necessarily supposes a universal history rooted in progress towards what he believes to be the realization of freedom.  Therein Marx incorporates both Hegelian and Kantian theories of history—progress and freedom.  The only difference to be found is in the motives of the actors.  Hegel and Kant would suggest reason drives the action of history, while Marx would say it is economics and class conflict.  Does this shift make that much of a difference?   Is the major difference between these theories they political outlook of the theorists themselves?  Is history simply a method of interpreting the past which is easily corrupted by theoreticians to achieve political&nbsp;ends?</p>

<p>Maybe Marx just annoys me so I want to annoy him.  I want to shout out: Annoy the liberals! Work hard and be&nbsp;happy.</p>
