<p>Carole Pateman&#8217;s <em>The Sexual Contract</em> operates on the premise that current social-contract theory misses a vital point, that the contract is not simply a political one but a sexual one. The political right invoked in the social contract is, in her opinion, also a patriarchal right or sex-right, giving men power over women. She argues that the creation of social contract-based civil society is also a new patriarchal society. This is innovative, in her argument, because traditionally patriarchy has been defined as the power of the father, not the power of the husband over the wife or man over woman; writing at the end of the 80&#8217;s, I will buy this theory, at least thus far—it&#8217;s still early enough that, perhaps, feminist arguments about the patriarchy have not breached into the mainstream, or at least not into contract theory.<br /><br />The connection between the marriage contract and the social contract, which she lays out at the beginning (it&#8217;s nice of her to clearly state the purpose of her book and its framework right off the bat, at least), is an interesting one, and, to be frank, the part of this book that I found both most intellectually stimulating and most relevant to her topic. The idea of the marriage contract both being perpetuating the dominance of the woman by the man in the modern era, and its connection to civil society via the social contract, was not something I&#8217;d ever considered, even though I had thought long and hard about the implications of marriage in my younger, commitment-phobic days. I certainly don&#8217;t believe that the link between the marriage contract and the slave contract, or even the patriarchal dominance of women, is necessarily true in the West today (and she&#8217;s only interested in the Anglophone West, so I feel qualified to make such judgments), but as a historical topic it was… illuminating.<br /><br />Now, I have to say I&#8217;ve never met anyone who claimed that the advent of &#8220;civil society&#8221; and the modern era led to an end of the patriarchy or the domination of women by men, if these were topics they discussed at all. I am not necessarily familiar with the debates over the term patriarchy, or feminist theory or history, but… and her insistence on the negative aspects of the marriage contract, that it is in essence a tool of oppression solely, regardless of how men and women attempt to break out of it… well, let&#8217;s just say I entered the second chapter of the book a bit leery of what I would find. Intrigued, and at least attempting to maintain a positive attitude, but leery.<br /><br />The second chapter was a very useful overview of the term &#8220;patriarchy&#8221; and its use for her purposes. I also noticed that the sensation of being screamed at, or at least severely berated, ceased in this chapter. I was familiar with a paternalism version of patriarchy and its relationship to the state, but again, patriarchy in a feminist context is one I am familiar with in only the most general terms. Linking the two forms of patriarchy, and how they interact with society, was a helpful refresher.<br /><br />Chapter three returns to marriage, and I have to admit, personal bias gets in my way of appreciating her point, because I find her arguments about marriage narrow-minded. In theory, marriage in the modern day is between equals—arguments about rings denoting ownership are nonsense, the marriage contract in the modern era in an equal undertaking, and in the Anglophone world nowadays you don&#8217;t even need cause for divorce, so it&#8217;s surprisingly easy for both men and women to get out of it. Alimony, child support, etc. in general mean that men (overwhelmingly the higher earners still, though that&#8217;s another discussion) continue to help women out after a divorce. Even historically, most marriage contracts have provided women with some rights, however limited, and even sexually women were supposed to have the right to their husbands body during the middle ages. Of course, I&#8217;m not arguing that marriage is not historically a mostly repressive regime of men dominating women physically, sexually, emotionally, politically, economically, etc., because it was and in some parts of the world still is. But in the Anglophone world, which is her specific focus, she continues to discuss marriage as if it were still this way, and it&#8217;s not.<br /><br />So there&#8217;s my little rant, and I won&#8217;t mention it again.<br /><br />Once she gets back to the nature of contract theory, I perked back up. The link between slavery as a contract and social contracts in general was interesting, and I think fits in very well with our discussions of the capitalist &#8220;world&#8221; system and the wage slave (as she mentions), but I was left somewhat confused as to how the slave contract and the sexual contract really interrelate.<br /><br />The fourth chapter, and the parts dealing with the fraternity aspect of the patriarchy, and the father-right, and the religious aspects thereof were all interesting. The links between Locke&#8217;s vision of the father-ruler and the patriarchal basis of rulership were pretty clear, as well as the way his vision of the social contract could lead to a directly patriarchal civil society. This section, discussing solely the original social contract theorists and their vision of a patriarchal society, makes perfect sense, even the inclusion of marriage into the debate. I can very clearly see her point, that this vision of civil society completely excludes women from the social contract and therefore from the civil society.<br /><br />I am not going to mention my thoughts on how she ended the chapter, or the last paragraph of chapter four. At all.<br /><br />At the beginning of chapter five she does finally mention that the world of the classic contract is essentially different in many ways from our modern social world. I wish she had presented that understanding all along, and at least mentioned at the beginning that her concepts of some things were based on more classical notions.<br /><br />She kept discussing how wives are like servants—does she not mention women in the workforce at all? Right, end of the 80s. Man, I would love to read an updated version of this for 2010.<br /><br />The model of economic coercion and essentially work-whoring is not a crazy one—actually, it made a lot of sense. The economic aspects of marriage are pretty clear, supportive of her argument, etc. I think we&#8217;ve talked sufficiently about wage slaves for one semester though. Or at least I have.<br /><br />Her discussion about marriage as being akin to the contract between a prostitute and her client was applicable. I guess. I mean, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve never thought about it in those terms, I&#8217;ve just never thought about it as being the exact parallel for the marriage contract, or built into civil society. I think prostitution should be legalized, personally, for the purpose of improving standards for something that will happen anyway—I was fascinated reading this chapter.<br />In the end, I find her original argument, that social contract is both a political and sexual contract, that led, at least in its original form, to a patriarchal civil society, to be pretty persuasive. I do not think the book was particularly well-organized or written, and I thought there were a number of digressions and side-arguments that were deeply unnecessary, but after reading the book I&#8217;m at least convinced that her reinterpretation of social contract is both innovative and useful.<br /><br />Judith Butler&#8217;s text is more familiar to me, as both my thesis advisor and my faculty supervisor at my old school were heavily involved in queer theory and taught classes on it annually, so I&#8217;ve read excerpts before and some articles by Butler. I liked her preface, both because of the humility it displays and in that she makes her point pretty clear—feminist theory was, and in some ways still is, pervasively heterosexual, and focuses on traditional gender identities and how they affect the world. The discussion of gender and what it means is productive ground for study—I&#8217;m taking &#8220;Gender and Sexuality in Early Christianity&#8221; this semester, and it&#8217;s fantastic.<br /><br />I&#8217;m slightly interested in this basis in &#8220;French Theory.&#8221;<br /><br />Now, as of this point, all I can read on Google Books in the Preface. I&#8217;ll happily read the other chapters when a course link is provided—Butler is a great writer, and while gender theory is not my area, it is interesting ground to tread.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5106592513198462604-2744478786445409601?l=tlecaque.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
