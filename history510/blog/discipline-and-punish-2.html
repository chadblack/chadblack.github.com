<p>Hmmm, last week the wink, this week the gaze…<br /><br />The cover of this book says it&#8217;s about the birth of the prison, and the title includes the word punish.  I was not looking forward to reading it, and the first chapter more than confirmed my trepidation.  It went beyond making a point to pure sensationalism.  I was in a pretty foul mood as I began the rest of the book.<br /><br />However, even with a bad attitude and three nights of inadequate sleep, this book managed to be better than I&#8217;d dreaded.  Within the framework of narrating the evolution from bodily punishment that proved the monarch&#8217;s power to internal discipline and training as a more subtle and pervasive way to control behavior, Foucault made several observations that I appreciated.  And then, rereading a book for my historiography project, I thought I recognized an idea, and—yes!—Gorski had indeed included Foucault in his bibliography.  I feel like maybe I have a toe in the doorway to this club called History.<br /><br />So, here are a few of the thoughts I had, in no particular order, since my brain is apparently on strike. <br /><br />Pg 98-99 different punishments for different people:  this is still true for teaching and parenting (an association I made over and over through this book, by the way) but we don&#8217;t seem to apply it much for criminals, beyond cushy prisons for some and nasty prisons for others.  I wonder what stands in the way of discovering a criminal&#8217;s button and then pushing it, instead of just using incarceration for everyone.<br /><br />It&#8217;s not the severity of punishment that&#8217;s its best deterrent; it&#8217;s the certainty of punishment.  I found that was true with teaching.  I could have a ridiculously minor punishment, but because it was so consistently applied, it really did keep the kids from misbehaving.  I wish we could apply this to greater society.  If jail were shorter but certain, with no hope of evading the police or getting off for some technicality, maybe it would be a better deterrent.  Really, after seeing what power a two-minute detention had, I&#8217;d believe most anything.<br /><br />He returned often to the relationship between power and knowledge.  He kept the discussion pretty close to his theme of prisons and punishment, but they interact in dozens of other ways in our society, too—lobbyist, expert testimony, psychologists overriding common wisdom, nutritional fads, scientists on a pedestal, and so on.  The person with the knowledge does have power over those who don&#8217;t really know.  It works in arguments, too.  <br /><br />Observation is an element of power.  How does that speak to anthropologists who observe groups of people—does that give them power over those groups?  Are there different kinds of observation, or just different uses for the results?  Observation yields knowledge, so that&#8217;s related to the knowledge/power connection.  And again with the teaching—the better I knew my students, the more clearly I knew their buttons and could adjust their carrots and sticks.  I just can&#8217;t get over how often this book was just parenting/teaching writ large.  No wonder I wanted out of public schools!<br /><br />It does bug me that I don&#8217;t see why this book was included in the syllabus.  What did it contribute to the development of historiography?  What was Foucault&#8217;s new angle or insight or paradigm?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-3778686751177189112?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
