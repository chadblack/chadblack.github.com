<p>Foucault starts the book with a public execution for a man convicted of regicide in 1757. He rightfully spares no detail in the proceedings of the execution, notable for its terrorizing use of state-sponsored violence(3-5). These details are necessary because it is central to his work that this type of sentence blurred the line between crime and punishment. Foucault incisively looks at the changing philosophies of the penal system, including notions of punishment from physical pain to the suspension of liberties, the concern over the body or the soul of the detained, and the role of judges and nature of judgments(19, 21).  I was particularly interested in this section on the way the vengeance of the king was carried out, since an affront to the law is an attack on the king&#8217;s figurative person. However, the king did not actually carry out this vengeance, himself, and could always provide a dramatic pardon, much to the crowd&#8217;s delight(53). Thus the king could maintain a certain distance from the actual carnage, while the bloodshed was done in his name and by his&nbsp;command(49).</p>

<p>In a similar vein, the executioner had an interesting connection to social control. He bears the brunt of association with state-ordered killing, and is quickly reprimanded if the execution is not carried out correctly. If he administers too much pain, he could be mercilessly insulted and even attacked by the crowd, and if he fails, the person could be freed(though this practice is later stopped)(52). This connects to the designated notion of pain punishments, as a particular amount of pain was to be exacted in response to particular crimes. Even if the person was condemned to death, the crowd watched to be sure they got death only once, unless their punishment specifically decreed otherwise. I had always thought &#8220;die a thousand deaths,&#8221; was a hyperbole, but it in fact denotes a particular way of killing a person, seemingly equivalent to the pain of dying many times. This system was further refined as punishments were specifically related to the crime (symbolic punishments, especially) and to the amount of pain deserved ( 45,&nbsp;89).</p>

<p>This show of force could backfire if the crowd sympathized with the convicted. If they died without blaspheming, they could be elevated to martyr-like status. If they died cursing authority, many in the crowd would enjoy that, too, and state officials were left with their &#8220;authority mocked and criminals transformed into heroes.&#8221;(61). The use of torture could also possibly backfire, as a person who stood up under being &#8220;put to the question,&#8221; could no longer be put to death, whatever other evidence was collected against&nbsp;them. </p>

<p>In switching focus to discipline, Foucault notes the way the body can be molded toward certain desirable ends, beginning with the example of a soldier. He then defines discipline, and says that &#8220;the historical moment of the disciplines was the moment when the art of the human body was born, which was directed not only at the growth of skills, nor at the intensification of its subjection, but at the formation of a relation that in the mechanism itself makes it more obedient as it becomes more useful, and conversely(138).<br />
I think this notion of discipline promoting usefulness is fascinating and is well documented in other parts of the section. Also important, and somewhat disturbing, is the idea of perfect observation, leading to the panopticism.<br />
    Finally, Foucault&#8217;s analysis of other methods of discipline and punishment toward the end of the book are well placed, since he is right to assert that concern over the penal system does not just take place during reform movements, but is in a more continual state of&nbsp;development(235). </p>

<p>In discussion tomorrow, I hope we can devote some time to these questions, (among others) since these topics were of particular interest to&nbsp;me:</p>

<p>How does the role of the crowd relate to the system of public punishment? How can it enhance and undermine the effectiveness of the&nbsp;punishment? </p>

<p>How does Foucault define discipline and how does this shape this argument for the latter half of the&nbsp;book? </p>

<p>How does religion seem to intersect penal theory, in its various stages of&nbsp;development?  </p>
