<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Archive Stories&#8221; presented a number of different takes on the archive, beginning with personal experiences with using archives to the creation of them to their role in politics.  Overall, I found the essays very interesting and thought-provoking; however, some of the ones in the middle section, such as the essays about the &#8220;suffragette spirit&#8221; and Kohler, <span class="caps">WI</span>, had the definite feel of having originally been written for another purpose and only superficially adapted, with an introduction and conclusion, to fit this collection.  I was also struck by the interconnectedness of the essays.  Almost all of them made multiple references to others in the collection, and I wondered how much a particular entry had been revised in relation to the others.  I&#8217;ve had this thought before when reading essay/article collections, in which a brief mention will be made to another entry, but I had never encountered such interconnectedness before.<br /><br />The different takes on the archive were quite interesting, and it was also nice to have oral archives included.  Previously, I hadn&#8217;t given much thought to the archive as a thing, to its biography, as one of the authors stated.  The archive was just the place where lovely, useful books and documents were stored.  Instead, though, our work as historians is dependent upon years of archival selection: what is kept and made available based on interest, national goals, and from reading Robertson&#8217;s (somewhat whiny at times) essay, the whims of the archivists themselves.  I had, of course, realized that archives did not contain entire documentary histories, but I hadn&#8217;t grasped the degree to which they were filtered, for lack of a better term.<br /><br />I appreciated Digital History&#8217;s practical nature; it&#8217;s the type of thing that I&#8217;ve bookmarked to return to as a guide, for if I need/want to create a stronger digital presence in the future.  While the author&#8217;s are aware of limits regarding the internet and digitizing materials, they make a strong argument for its benefits.  Their discussion of copyright and fair use policy was equally helpful.  As someone who has strong feelings about the glories of the printed page, I must admit to having reservations about going too far toward the internet.  So many websites are not reputable (although, of course, with training, they can be spotted and avoiding, just as printed popular histories can be), and then there&#8217;s the question of the ephemeral nature of individual sites, discussed by Sentilles in her Archives Stories submission (I realize that one could also argue that paper is ephemeral, what with fire and the ease of shredding documents and throwing them away).  Ultimately, I see the digital world as having distinct uses, and certainly some advantages in terms of easy communication and access to documents without travel expenses, but I don&#8217;t think it replaces print culture.  At least, not yet.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6220711600267285330-71857890924999059?l=jawhite21.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
