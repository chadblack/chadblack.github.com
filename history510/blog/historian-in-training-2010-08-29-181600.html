<p>When I first discovered that this book was dedicated solely to the issue of footnotes, I must admit that I was not quite as excited as some of my colleagues seem to have been. Footnotes, while I have always conceded their necessity and usefulness, have never truly found a place in my historical heart. I am happy to say, however, that this book brought a new life and meaning to the footnote that has since convinced me to rethink my position.<br /><br />The footnote was a sadly overlooked topic at my undergraduate college, and we were taught to use it only in the modernized form that Grafton laments. I never truly understood how simplified this one-sided use of the footnote was until Grafton&#8217;s text delved into the myriad ways in which the footnote has been and ought to be used. Rather than simply&nbsp; being a tool to help insure historical veracity, footnotes in fact form a story of their own, one that tells as much about the author as is does the subject being discussed. Whether the footnote is in narrative form or providing supporting evidence, these brief side points allow a more personal glimpse of the author to come through than would be considered appropriate within the actual text itself.<br /><br />Much like historical thought is constantly changing and developing, the footnote too is a surprisingly fluid concept. It reflects general intellectual trends of the time and provides a strong indication of the way a particular period approached the subject of history. For as long as histories have been around, the footnote has been a proud declaration of contemporary historical values. Even the absence of footnotes provides an indication of the importance placed on historical truth, or rather the failure to do so. There was no steady path culminating in the institutionalized version of today&#8217;s footnote, nor did it simply spring into existence fully formed and ready to go. The development of the footnote has taken a long time and often followed a somewhat bumpy path; progress has not always characterized its evolution and at some points it seems to have actually regressed.<br /><br /><br />I was impressed that this book actually had me missing the &#8220;good old&#8221; footnotes by its conclusion, where stories were told and jabs made. I too have noticed an increasing trend in current historiographical works to dedicate footnotes solely to providing documentation and information regarding further reading. While these are of course critical to providing a valid historical work, they lack the punch found in narrative footnotes. Ranke&#8217;s great problem with footnotes was that they interrupted the text, but I find that my reading only feels interrupted when the footnotes are nothing but lines of abbreviations and numbers that take minutes to decipher. I tend to get inexplicably excited when I come across a footnote that is simply three of four lines of text, always hoping that it will provide a little side entertainment before returning to the main work. While it is not practical, or even desirable, to constrain modern usage of the footnote to its narrative form, it would be appreciated to see a little more life fed back into the bottom of the page. I doubt this will happen any time soon, however, for as Grafton points out the footnote is essential to a historian and his/her work. Although footnotes are unable to definitively prove an author&#8217;s point, they provide the best reassurance we have to the veracity of a historical study and reflect the time and effort a historian put into their work. As such, the footnote is an essential tool for any professional historian and, like it or not, is around to stay.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8178754167783429510-4732529172105592074?l=amandah-historianintraining.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
