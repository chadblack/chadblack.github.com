<p>Pateman&#8217;s &#8220;Sexual Contract&#8221; argues that there is an implicit, often overlooked and hidden, sexual component to the Enlightenment social contract theory.  She argues that &#8220;patriarchy&#8221; is often understood to involve a parental relationship; its strict male/female meaning generally neglected  As such, she seems to predate Bennett&#8217;s argument from last week that &#8220;patriarchy&#8221; should make a comeback in discussions of gender and feminism.  In the modern era, Pateman presents a rather bleak picture of male oppression of women, arguing that although women in the Anglo countries she studies have reached a level of judicial equality, they are still secondary to men in marital relationships and in the question of prostitution.  I did notice that the studies she cites to support her arguments about the views of wage-earning married women were published in the early 1980s, with data likely gathered from the late 1970s; I questioned how dependent she should be on their findings nearly ten years later.  Her use of Freud was surprising; she acknowledges that he is not normally used in discussions of social contract theory, and I was often unclear as to whether she was applying his views about fraternity and sons displacing the fathers to the late twentieth century or not (her love of the historical present and her often sloppy use of the word &#8220;contemporary&#8221; didn&#8217;t help).  Many psychologists now dismiss the details of Freud&#8217;s theories, and so I questioned how relevant they were to Pateman&#8217;s argument.<br /><br />Butler analyzes the idea of compulsory heterosexuality in her attempts to re-examine the construction of gender and its interplay with sex.  Throughout, she points out flaws in and deconstructs previous theorists&#8217; work.  I was surprised not to find a discussion of Scott&#8217;s article (unless I overlooked it).  In the process of taking apart so many other theories, I somewhat lost track of what Butler was proposing.  I <em>think</em> she is advocating for defining gender as a performance.  Wittig&#8217;s view, discussed in the last chapter, that not only gender, but also sex, is constructed was interesting; I hadn&#8217;t previously run across that viewpoint.  Butler&#8217;s discussion of grammar and language was sometimes murky, but I was struck by the statement in the last chapter, regarding the French use of masculine &#8220;ils&#8221; as the normative, universal &#8220;they.&#8221;  Throughout her book, whenever she wrote about masculine as universal and feminine as particular, I kept thinking about &#8220;ils&#8221; and its Spanish corollary &#8220;ellos.&#8221;  Thus, it was good to have her give that example to confirm my reading of that portion her text.  (Interestingly, German just has one, non-gendered word for &#8220;they,&#8221; &#8220;sie,&#8221; which happens to also be the singular feminine subject pronoun.)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6220711600267285330-7176255148315643303?l=jawhite21.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
