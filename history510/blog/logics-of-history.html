<p>This was a great book.  It clarified and explained several terms I&#8217;ve run across elsewhere (discursive, cultural turn, etc) and gave an excellent grounding in some recent-ish theories and trends in history and the social sciences.  It would have been nice to have read this earlier in the semester, actually.<br /><br />William Sewell is an interdisciplinary scholar who works in history as well as several of the social sciences.  As a die-hard generalist, I appreciated the breadth of his perspective and the way he connected disparate threads.  I also noted a strong tendency toward favoring Both/And over Either/Or, which I also enjoyed.  Sewell consistently provides several apparently contradictory conceptions, and then shows how they actually act together to reinforce each other.  He does this, obviously, with history and the social sciences, but also with events and theories, symbols and materiality, synchronic and diachronic analyses, language metaphors and construction metaphors, and more.  Accepting and integrating both is a great way to side-step conflict, and it gives you more tools in your toolbox as well.<br /><br />This book was written over many years as individual essays that he gathered and revised for this publication.  It&#8217;s easy to see his include-it-all position through the various angles and treatments in these individual works, but it would have been nice to have a bit more of a…hmm, &#8220;story arc&#8221;, I guess.  I wish that chapter 10 had been more of a summary, consolidation, conclusion sort of end, instead of yet another discussion of contradictions that are actually complements.  The book just stopped, instead of concluding with a distilled statement of the whole picture.<br /><br />Until the abrupt and unsatisfying end, though, this book was full of great insights and ideas to think about.  I liked the several places where Sewell suggested that one of the reasons we study history (or the social sciences) is to show why things happened then and thereby illuminate why things are happening now, to some extent or another.  I liked the contingency and agency that kept recurring, especially in light of our depressing conversations about capitalism.  He does a very good job of showing why it&#8217;s not as grimly inevitable as that Latin America/Africa book made it seem.<br /><br />In fact, this book had so much great stuff in it, I had a harder than usual time finding the forest beyond all the interesting trees.  I guess that&#8217;s part of my problem with the lack of conclusion.  Here, then, is my stab at summarizing his ten essays:<br /><br />Chapter one was an introduction of sorts, laying out his intention to combine the strengths of history and the strengths of social science.  History is good at particulars, narrative, sequential chronology, and showing the lumpiness of change over time.  The social sciences are better at big-picture generalities, theories and laws, regularities, continuities, and big scope.  They each have something to offer the other that would improve both fields.<br /><br />Chapter two was cast as an autobiography, to show what social history was, how it rapidly evolved to cultural history, and what was lost in the wholesale (well, &#8220;most-sale&#8221;, actually) transition.  This resembled in many ways his chapter on the differences between social science and history just before.  Again, he says we need to incorporate skills and interests from both in order to give thorough descriptions of our subjects.<br /><br />Chapter three considers three temporalities—teleological (long-term, progressing toward a goal), experimental (slices of time to compare equivalent and independent events), and eventful (how events are able to transform social structures).  He also discusses that time moves at three different rates—structural (centuries), conjunctual (decades), and eventful (&#8220;froth on the waves&#8221;)—so any good description needs to tease out different contexts and explain how they&#8217;re each contributing to the situation under consideration.  He ended by sharing three examples of how the concept of enduring structures can be integrated with a history of events to show how events transform structures.<br /><br />Chapter four looked more closely at these structures that social scientists are so fond of.  They include both schemas and resources, and we live in many different structures, which overlap and interact in many ways.  This multitude of structures is what allows human agency and creativity.  Chapter five continued this look at our context for living, although here he called it culture.  Culture is a collection of overlapping systems of symbols and meanings that people use and act within to live their lives.  As they live those lives, their actions may alter the symbols and meanings that enabled the actions.  Each culture encompasses many differences and has ways of organizing this variety to produce coherence.<br /><br />Chapter six compared the strengths of history and anthropology, as well as how very similar they really are.  Anthropology looks at humans across space, studying the differences possible within a still-human context in order to distill what it means to be human, and historians do somewhat the same thing only across time.  Both of these fields show that a lot of what we take for granted is actually quite contingent.  He also discussed how culture and large brains developed together, because brains give us more options and culture helps us choose between them in the absence of instinct.  And he showed the slippage available between elements of culture that allow for change.<br /><br />Chapter seven looked at Sahlins&#8217; description of Cook&#8217;s arrival in Hawaii to show how events can change social structures.  Events grow from and act within many kinds and scopes of structures, but slippage, change in resources, and human intentions can rearrange the symbols and their meanings and thereby transform the basic structures of interpretation.<br /><br />Chapter eight did about the same thing for the original Bastille Day.  After an extended description of the events, he analyzed them to show how an act of violence was absorbed and interpreted to become the novel concept of an initiation of political revolution.  From this, he laid out an elaborate theory of events that incorporates structures, culture, conditions, emotions, creativity, ritual, event cascades, authoritative sanction, spatial elements, and arbitrary boundaries.<br /><br />Chapter nine began with a very long description of the dockworkers in Marseilles in order to show how some structures can persist even when surrounded by changing circumstances.  In the analysis that followed his long description, he showed how there were several temporalities and different sized structures operating, and then he explained how each one contributed to the persistence of their position, and their evolution from conservative to liberal politics.   This was an example of the combination of historical narrative and social science analysis that he&#8217;s calling for throughout this book.<br /><br />Chapter ten tried to define &#8220;social&#8221;.  After an interesting etymology, he shared the language metaphor, some detractors, and how it can be stretched to answer their challenges.  Then he showed the advantages of a mechanistic/quantitative analysis for when your data are obscure, sparse, or unwieldy in narrative form, and how these strategies can show the contingency behind what had previously seemed to be &#8220;blind forces&#8221;.  Then he explored the social construction metaphor to show that we have more agency than we believe, and that materiality is as significant as symbology.  He finished this chapter by saying that we need to incorporate both the language metaphor and the construction one in order to adequately perceive the society and culture we&#8217;re studying.<br /><br />And then it was done.  <br /><br />As is this blog, so Philip—whoever you are—you can unfollow me now so I no longer feel like I&#8217;m being stalked.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-1983531106883465871?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
