<p>Due to my apparent habit (once is an accident, twice is a habit) of forgetting the accompanying article until alerted by my colleagues&#8217; blogs, I decided to begin with the Butler excerpts.  Also, after that enticing disclaimer in class, I hoped that Pateman would be like dessert in comparison.<br /> <br />Butler&#8217;s language didn&#8217;t turn out to be as bad as I&#8217;d expected, despite having to read from a screen, but her content was disappointing.  Well, uneven, I guess.  There were parts that I found interesting, and even a few things I enjoyed, but overall, I just wanted to shriek, So <span class="caps">WHAT</span>!!!  I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m fed up with theory in general or the persecution complex and contentious perspective of the last few readings, but I know I&#8217;ve had it with reading page after page of verbose, self-aggrandizing vocabulary manipulations that just over-inflate small ideas to make them seem more significant.  Seriously, if you can&#8217;t say it succinctly, you don&#8217;t understand it well enough.  <br /><br />So, rant aside, here&#8217;s what I took away, beginning with my favorite quote of the whole book:  &#8220;&#8230;trouble is inevitable and the task, how best to make it, what best way to be in it.&#8221;  With a start like that, I figured this would be great.  Sigh.<br /><br />She presented several ideas, over and over, among them:<br />1) Gender is a performance—something we do, not something we are—and so doesn&#8217;t need to be limited to two choices.  She mentioned her uncle as being institutionalized just because he didn&#8217;t fit into one of those slots.<br />2) Language supports the naturalizing of gender and sex.  The word &#8220;women&#8221; is inadequate both because it&#8217;s only one aspect of a person and because it&#8217;s expected to refer to such a variety of people that is ceases to have meaning (sort of like our complaint of &#8220;lesbian-like&#8221; last week).  I also liked her crack that pronouns become a problem here, on…some page that I can&#8217;t find now!<br />3) Since gender is a construct, it is a cause of our perception of sexual differentiation instead of being a result of any inherent differences.  Here she pulled in Foucault&#8217;s idea around how prohibiting delinquency in effect created the category of delinquency.  This has some merit, I suppose, in an ivory-tower theoretical sort of way, but I&#8217;ve changed enough diapers to say that you don&#8217;t need a pink ribbon glued to a bald head to see what you&#8217;re dealing with once the tape comes off.  Maybe this is more effort to make Middlesex people ordinary instead of exceptional.  I did like her explanation of Foucault in the 1990 preface, though I didn&#8217;t understand why he called this a genealogy. &#8220;…genealogy investigates the political stakes in designating as an origin and cause those identity categories that are in fact the effects of institutions, practice, discourses with multiple and diffuse points of origin…&#8221; (xxix)<br />4) Finally! The drag section didn&#8217;t come until the last part of the last chapter.  It provided a glimmer of concreteness to what she&#8217;d been talking around through all those previous pages.  Drag shows that surface indications aren&#8217;t true, which extends the thought to body elements.  Just as &#8220;female&#8221; clothes cover a &#8220;male&#8221; body, so does a &#8220;male&#8221; body cover a &#8220;female&#8221; self.  Drag is simultaneously anatomy, identity, and performance, each out of expected alignment, which thereby shows all three to be contingent.  The parody of drag provides freedom from the hegemony of the binary cultural expectations.<br /><br />Then, to Pateman, supposedly my dessert.  She was easier to read, but she&#8217;s still contentious and verbose, using too many words and too many disparate sources to supposedly prove her point.  She claims that contract theory obscures reality because it ignores the sexual contract that undergirds and predates it.  She sees contracts as creating domination instead of limiting it.<br /><br />I wonder if she&#8217;s finding what she&#8217;s looking for, even though it&#8217;s no longer (if ever) true.  She wrote 22 years ago, but even then, women weren&#8217;t relegated to the private sphere because they were considered less rational than men.  If anything, women were considered inadequate by other women when they chose the private sphere.  The women&#8217;s movement, in demanding equal access to one style of life, has inadvertently (I hope) suggested that other styles are a betrayal.  In any case, society has come a long way from the vision she argues against.  I wonder—given my abhorrence for confrontation—how much of the progress has come from radical exaggerations and theoretical flights, and how much has resulted from a more incremental, persistent &#8220;add women and stir&#8221; approach.<br /><br />Reading these two books suggested to me where our leeriness about feminist theory may be coming from.  Both of these were very political, abstract, and strident.  They include a lot of extreme ideas ungrounded in specific, concrete examples.  They deal with society on a mega-level, calling for massive changes to all of reality, instead of focusing on a manageable sphere of influence where something might actually happen.  Fundamentally, despite Pateman&#8217;s lead sentence on page one, there aren&#8217;t enough stories.  I want a pictures from which to hang all her big ideas.  <br /><br />I realize this is a theory class, but I&#8217;m beginning to feel like the cartoon guy crawling across the desert:  Must…Find…Narrative…<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1409927770478699057-7360964156996088641?l=mollyskippymom.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div></p></article>			</div>
